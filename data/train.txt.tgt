i was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . it was a challenge for a person with a finance background . i met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . based on that information , i selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . we got the project done on schedule . i was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team .

yeah . so did you do anything else ?
do not feel that way . i know you are very smart . note - taking is a special skill . all students need to learn it . some people are very smart , but they just have not learned how to take notes yet . i am lucky because i had a good english teacher in high school . she taught me how to take good notes . it is not hard .
and also tell me how to use other switches .

i do not know about that with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i do not know if you are aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there is just too much instability . i would not feel comfortable investing in this climate .
ok . there is no subway in my city .
i am a sales manager in a publishing company .
he is on the line .

i am sorry , but you will not be able to view it today .

even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences .
okay , so friday at what time ?
have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ?
i am studying law .
yes , of course . it is so much easier than cash , to be honest nowadays i hardly ever use cash . i just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month .
i do not think so . in korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together .
you married him for that reason ?
no , not this weekend . i have too much work to do .
are you having problems ? this is the first i have heard of it .
harris and anne are perfect for each other .
yeah ... actually , we have not hung out at all recently . you seem sort of under the weather . is there something going on ?
well , i do not have any cash with me , so i will have to put it on credit .
this is not like you ... well , i hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business .
i do not have a library card .
i will take you to the assembly shop ...

you are a quick learner . i do not think you will have any trouble with this .
so am i . the doctor says she will get over in a month .

yeah , and though the king in chess does not have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . i think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval europe than in china .

no , ma'am . i am afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime .
yeah . that is the one .
i would recommend del .
it is usually a bit hotter than today .
you are really a hen-pecked husband .
well , it is a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves .
i know this is going to sound sexist , but i do not think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
hold on for a moment . a few minutes later i have cancelled your reservation . shall i make another one for you ?
but you are not to blame for them keeping him there .
she is pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally .

miss , i just cannot help you on this . i am a pharmacist , not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it . i am sorry .
that is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .

i like scary movies .
all right . may i have your name , sir ?
is the room ready for the lecture now ?
not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so i can explain the game to you .
i would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . it is about the overtime you have asked me to put in .
i blew the finally exam .
just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left .
how long was she employed with your company ?
soft-boiled , please .

where do i catch the train ?
no , not for this country .
i would not mind getting some chinese food .

i do not think i could afford that kind of car again . i think i will have to choose something that is not as hard to replace .
yes , what can i do for you , sir ?
well , let me see . i would like to go to the great wall , the summer palace , the forbidden city and the temple of heaven .
i remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . i waited for the traffic light for a very long time .
if you could just talk to him , i would greatly appreciate it .
no no , i just changed my eating habits . i eat a balance meal . and i eat less than before .
i think it is bleeding .
they caught him before he could walk through the front door .
a little actually . my sinuses are a little blocked up as well-i really feel terrible .

well , i think we would better go now . we have to follow the guide .
no , thanks . i am in a hurry .
i will call again in twenty minutes . thanks .
a well-learned person never does that .
no problem , sir . he will be with you in just a minute . could i get you something to drink while you are waiting ?
thanks . now fill this out .
it is not the right material . or the right color . i cannot possibly accept it .
well , we can wait for the assistant to help us , or we can look through the boxes down here . what is your size ?
thank you for your caring . i will .
well , the bill is paid by month . that is probably the only thing that i like about a take-out restaurant .
how much is it ?
no , i do not .
yes , i like inventive jobs and i am capable and responsible .
sure . what are they ?
those patio tables are new , are not they ? would it be possible to be seated out there ?
just looking at some books on how to learn english .

yes , i do .
do you have the receipt with you ?
please sit down and make yourself at home . please do not stand on ceremony .
this is not the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . i need to start the procedure to evict you .

squid balls ? how about some more fruit !
there is evidence ! you know edwin hubble ? he is the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would it be expanding from ? well , the big bang ... duh !

i thought it was over there .
i talked to her for a while , but she is really depressed . so , i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
say it ! what is it ?
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
i am sure i will like it here .
i do not really like henry . i like my rose .
you are joking !
you can get cheap carpets easily . another idea is to buy a rug . that would cover a lot of the carpet and you would not have to replace the carpet . it would save you a lot of work .
okay . but be prepared for an all-nighter ! i doubt you will want to put it down either .
we have only one position open .
yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office .
no , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge .
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
i think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat .
well . during the college years , i worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer is offices . does that count ?
that sounds good . how much is one ?
we can pig out on potato chips and cookies . they are very cheap .
okay . can i also have a sheet of 20 sixty-four-cent stamps ?
then take your time , please .
that is pretty chilly for the summer ! will it rain on saturday ?
how much will the fine be ?
it all started the day before yesterday .
i own a small rental unit with a partner , and i receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit .

what is your last name ?
i will do that . thank you . have a safe trip home .
it is too late . you see , in our market october is the season for the kind of commodity . so the goods must be shipped before october or we will not be ready for the season .
well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .
come off it , mary .
sorry sir , we will bring you one . anything else ?
here you are , sir . i am sure she will enjoy them .
would you like anything to drink ?
i started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
i want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . i am not sure i will be able to , though .
well i have to go , rock sam . you take it easy , ok .
are there many choices of online shopping ?
many thanks for your present . i am so glad you are able to come .
here is 4 dollars , keep the change .
we plan to go to a forest in the suburb . there is a beautiful river there . we can do some fishing .
it is 2: 42 by my watch . but it moves a bit fast .
do you know what she is doing now ?
tomorrow , i will cut the grass . then the garden will look perfect .

now and then .

a couple of days ago . i just go back from the funeral .
i expect all chinese can play table tennis .
did they go with the proposed counter-offer ?
yes , i have been there several times on business trips . but i have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
i bought it online .
is this evening too soon ?
i have a headache .
oh , is not your computer wi-fi capable ?
you look lost . can i help you ?
how about a laptop ?
keep your fingers crossed . she will bring home the bacon .
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . do not let me hold you up .
what happened ? quarrel again ?
let is go to the snacks section . i want some chocolate and sweets .
how can it be cliche ? it is a fable ! it is telling a time-honoured story ! the movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .
i think so . i think you would better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available .
all right , i see .
ron , have a seat and i will get us something to drink .
i merely know how to send the direct letter . but i am not familiar with the attachment .
i will buy it if forty .
thanks . how much would that come to ?
what about her facial features ?
i think mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much .
sure . how do you like your money ?
three bags and a suitcase . this is my luggage to check .
janice has just got sick and i need a hand now . could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ?
we waited until our one year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .

it is my pleasure to see you off .
hopefully by tomorrow evening . which hotel are you going to stay ?
what are they ?
no , thanks . i am fine . did you have a nice holiday ?
that is good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
yeah , i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
mr green , please .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
did not you just finish watching a basketball game on tv ?
look , i have already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we are going to finish watching it .
as a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now .
which direction were you coming from ? and which direction were you going ?
it will be a piece of cake .
have you worked anywhere else before ?
i have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
of course not .
oh , but this pair of shoes are a bit too tight . could i change them for something bigger ?
i was in a comfortable place , so really , it is no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
okay . i will pay the charges .
how much did it cost you ?
are you sure you cannot remember ?
usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . the prices are very low . but you may find faulty products here too .
where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor is party at a etv , was not it ?
he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
thank you very much . i have been looking for it for a long time . is this the latest edition ?
it is instructive and inspiring .
well , thank you for your information . but what is the name of that restaurant again ?
see you tomorrow .
let is get start . what kinds of things do you have in mind ? if you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement .
he must be an experienced accountant .
yeah ? i guess so . i spent the weekend at beach .
okay . i understand . i will call the customer service office of the manufacturer . thank you .
i still have no clue ... but we do not have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so i have got time ! oops , i am late for class . gotta run !
my sister has given me two tickets for tonight . it is called ' the life of rose ' , a french movie .
the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future .
i got to meet the night anger today too . we got along right from the start .
no problem at all . to tell you the truth , i could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork .
you will have to just read it in the library .
oh , kate ! i am sorry . it completely slipped my mind !
i need to get on the internet .
you mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
in particular , i am interested in marketing in the domestic field .
ok . i will take it .
sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and i get them involved with something constructive . some of them change their attitude later .
terrific ! b . a . , again and again-b . a .
what time would you like to see him ?
can i do all six hours in one day ?
i do have the confidence , but i still worry about her .
let me see . yes , mary . let is make it next wednesday .
what do you mean by that ?
you are welcome . we wish you a speedy recovery . goodbye .
let me know how it works .
yes , the service really added to the experience .
time flies ! one year has already been a history !
not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .
no , you are kidding . i am not taking it seriously .
well , i think you are pretty lucky actually . you will have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .
thank you . would it be ok if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ?
just tell her off .
i hope i can practice self-control again .
insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment will be paid by both the company and you , and the others by the company .
do you feel anything else ?
no , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs .
but remember , be careful when you ride a bike . the traffic in beijing can be dangerous .
this bs ischool you are going to is going to make your life easy .
but those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided .
would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ?
all right . and here is your deposit book .
certainly . no one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
you won a lottery ? do not beat around the bush , just tell me , please .
when you filled out your continued claim form , did you show that income ?
maybe , but i am not sure .
no . the front seat folds down all the way so there is just enough space for the skis ...
i have a meeting with my general manager .
that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ?
i saw the weather report , and it is going to rain for the next eight days .
six months isalary ? are you serious ? that is incredible !
we landed in southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .
that is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine . the catholics call it the eucharist .

i am glad to help .
have a nice nap .
very good . you can pick up your order in one week .
here you are . which size do you wear ?
congratulations ! you must be very proud of your achievement .
how about a movie ? we have not done that for a while .
if we do , too many people might attend . perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend .
when would you like your account closed ?
thank you , sir .
well , have a good day off from class .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let is look for a closed-toe shoe .
no way . do it yourself .
wow . i am getting rushed too , but just one . are you thinking of joining any of them ?
oh , cheer up . he will understand you .
i think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea .
here is the key then .
about five weeks .
that sounds simple enough . do you charge any admin fees for that ?
i have got a backache .
and the maximum loan amount ?
what time do you want us to wake you up ?
not really . there are not any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i will go to them .
yes . are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ?
of course . as for an entry-level accountant , we pay 1,500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate , they can earn at least 2 , 000 a month .

mr harold smith .

not just today . go exercise everyday !
that is pretty good . by the way , what are you doing next saturday ?
if you are hired , when can you start work ?
i hate to disappoint you , mr . brown , but if that is the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over , please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
sounds real good . it is a pity that i missed that .
here you are . what is the rate ?
what do you think i ought to do ?
we will have to hurry visiting hours will be over soon
yes . i have prepared the contract just so that you understand everything . so that you understand the terms .

oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
how long do you have ?
that is fine . i am looking forward to it .
i did not know it until yesterday . i put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married .

i took a cooking class at the culinary institute .
when is the big day ?

what would a typical day be like for me here ?
yes , i know what to do .
i want to make a deposit .
look ! the iron is still on .
i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i do not think we should use an agency , because they will not be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of the branch office ?
did not i tell you ? we are going to shanghai to stay with them in june .
so what do you want to play then ?
but it is worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .

i count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . does this look right to you ?
yes , that is quite all right for me . can we change it ?
it is wet and rains a lot . but right now it is the golden season to take a tour there . it is fine there almost everyday .
it is not gratitude . it is fear . vince is afraid i will jump to a competitor .
that is all right . we will get used to it . besides , it is quiet up there .
yes , that is what i am looking for . i will take the room for 2 days .
was it quite special ?
the dentist is very busy at the moment . can you come at 2 pm ?
it is difficult to explain . but this one is really cheap .

do not worry . anyway , you are better than me .
i apologize . what day was this purchase made ?
where is the peeler ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve .
well , that is true . in a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .
i knew i should not have shown you my new toy ...
i know , darling . but i do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me .
wounds good , and i do not have to queue up at the cashier .
i will go and quit my job in the abc company .

i am afraid so . i do not remember you telling me about it .
it will be cash today .

the summers are hotter . the last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . there have also been stronger winds .

no way . i want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . plus , what if it is vince ?
yes . should we go there by bus so we are not late ?
i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging , i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . i took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and i discussed and eventually resolved . my boss was impressed with the work i had done .
i really have to go .

can you tell me how to make it ?
i know what you mean . what can i get for you ?
can you fill out this form then ?
yes . and do not forget to list them by date . besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it is harder to make peace between countries .
are the prices on the list firm offers ?
why do not you sleep over ?
for example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction .
where are you going this summer vacation ?
oh yes , i am very interested in chinese history so i would like to visit the summer palace .

do not you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
yeah . it is not easy for them to find another job .
where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ?

a little of both . we will have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . those are available to everyone . we also have a variety of other programs
i hope so , dana . my instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but i am trying very hard to reach some middle ground .
maybe ... i will think about it .
you will not need it . tom is going to treat everybody !
the pleasure is ours . can you deliver the goods by march 31 ?
i sent in an absentee ballot .
then would you please make your prices cif including five percent ?

i have to exchange some money .
some dude came into the bank with a gun .
i am sure you did .
oh , it is really beautiful , but i just cannot dance it well .
i suppose you are right . they also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around .
oh , doctor , please ...
this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back , please ?
i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . how about meeting each other halfway ?
hi , mary . lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party .
thank you , dear . i feel better now .
yes , but i still think it could be better .
yes , besides mao tai , we have wu liang ye , fen jim and so on .
he is my brother .
let me try it on . i like that color .
sure , that would be great . where would you like to go ?
honey , you can ask him to be quite . otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
hi , an . how are you ?
yes , his iq is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his eq .
they are all produced in china , are not they ?
is he married ?
thank you for your help .
it should take at least 20 minutes to get there . are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?

you know , i like traveling . i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself .
thanks . i feel like celebrating . let is go have a beer . it is on me .

that birthday cake looks wonderful , but you have not put any candles on it yet .
if i hear love me tender one more time , i think i will go crazy !
it should take us back up to altadena .
one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families .
thank you very much . now , sir , do you have a credit card ?
yes , it is .
yes , we are very proud of her .
when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things .
for accounting system and things like that , you mean ?
yes , with the lux dandruff shampoo . it helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff .
i would rather you told her .
oh , sorry to hear that . this is quite unusual . i will look into the matter .
that is the company policy .
i have got it . i like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
we are nor alone here . so many other families !
so let me show you some of our dvd players . in my opinion , dvd is the wave of the future .
that is fine .
well , i cannot compare to you . i got a 3 . 1 in english 101 . that means if you got a lower grade in english 201 , it must be harder .
thank you . i suppose i should go to see a doctor .
how much do you need ?
then i will clean it the day after tomorrow .
the ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . is it true ?
no , could i also get some extra towels and soap too ? we went to the pool today and used up our two clean towels .
it does not matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
i think this color is not quite right for me . do they have the same dress in white ?
take it easy , jim . your mother did not mean it ! need any help ?
why cannot i view it today ?
the notification period of my current job is not that long and i am quite profession to english and i am happy with the traveling abroad as i am good dealing with the people from other cultures . it makes the whole job even more interesting . i will send my resume to you still this week .
we supply washers of all types and sizes . we have years of experience in the manufacture of washers .

and the number ?
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .
we ' get ' to stay home ? do you know something that i do not ?
just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . and more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job .
they arrested me without probable cause .
thank you for saying so . i do not know , probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues .
try this one . you can get a picture by simply pressing the shutter .
that is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men is jackets .
generally speaking , you are supposed to come at 9: 00 am .
is the service charge included ?
maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer .
but the ads say they are most nutritious .
yeah , i will try to do the same . so , i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
two weeks . if he thinks i will put up with his attitude that long he is got another thing coming .
yes , i will schedule you for that time .
please tell me where your daughter is home is .

well , they are for your wife , so i think you should give her roses .
how about this pen ?
oh , yes , mrs . saxton . please take a seat here .
the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection .
i got it .
generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .
yes . you sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .
there is some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . do you work in a cubicle ?
i think so .
why are you washing your clothes here now ?
this is my first tourism . i do not know what should be declared .
he would not say over the phone .
yes , it sure does . and with our new premises , we have new services . we can provide 24 - hour support for your wealth management .
we really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .
i am gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like halle .
me ? i am even less experienced than you are .
oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they are so scary .
why do you have to leave early ?
maybe you are right .
that is ok sometimes .

maybe i will cook once or twice a week . how is that ?
yes , i would , thank you .
yes , i will be promoted to department manager .
what classes do you think are still open ?
yeah , i know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . i think it is already healed .
savings , please .
fine ! i want a divorce !
yes , here you are .
how would you evaluate the company you are with ?
of course . here you are .
t t , please .

no problem , come on .
i need some remedies for an upset stomach .
really ? i have a weakness for coffee .
yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . we can see you are experienced in this particular line .
2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . there will be some seats to spare .
i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . we are on the 12th floor , so there is very nice view from the balcony .
i bid on a chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
oh , honey , i am so sorry , we do not have enough space for you to have your own room .
well , it really depends . because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices .
sure , merton financial advisors .
in that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest .
if you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week .
do you plan to pursue further education ?
talking about a barbecue , did not you say you are organizing one next week ?
how about the lunch break , lucy ?
excuse me ? i hope i did not just hear what i think i just heard .
you are really career minded .
i like this jacket . can i try it on ?
i attend an aerobic class three times a week .
it is ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
i know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . sleeping eight hours a day does not mean it is healthy . sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and i think this is your problem .
if a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . a team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .

this is my first day here .
but honey , i think you are terrific . there is nothing ...
what rental do you offer ?
i am afraid this flight is all booked up .

okay . full-size , mid-size or compact , ma'am ?
no , no , for the engagement .
i am totally with you on that .
racist ? not exactly . it is how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if i can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . suddenly i become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion .
i do yoga twice a weeks
well , you know i studied marketing in america . so maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . i would love to be part of the team .
ah ! she has a bad memory . how old is she ?
five hundred dollars , so you will pay ten dollars for the insurance . that is two percent of the total value of the article .

ok , let is go to the cinema to see what is on .
as along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay .
i am glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . but please do not think too unkindly of us .
would you like to have a perm ?
is there any particular size that you want ?
i only have one card .
i can check for you . could you describe the coat ?
our 15 - inch pro will cost you only $ 2,100 .
as you can see from the statements for my current account , i have never been overdrawn . i am always very careful about that .
that is all right . we do not go to bed early .

yes , that soup has a shrimp base . i also added sea vegetables and lemon grass .
i think that i could study a little harder for tests .
sarah and i could see eye to eye with each other .
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .
well , you could never tell about the weather here in new york .
i guess we would better get back to work .
really ? is there ' wall street journal ' , please ?
it is my dream .
he is fine . he retired last week . it is turning going in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
ok sir . at what time ?
en , i am looking for a porter , do you know where i can find one ?
not for now , i think , but i believe there will be rain , so take your raincoat with you .
ok . then tell me what else you know .
sure . while you are in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .
what ! with who ?
no , thank you . i can manage it , i think .
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .

i like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction .
i have paid the duty . here is the receipt
are you ok today ?
it is all yours .
oh , then when do you celebrate easter ?
ok . wait for a moment , please .
ah ! not on me ! ow !
you mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? to some extent your idea holds water . kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . now we are apt to treat it as an art .
it is not the same . it is completely different .
alright . good . i see you have already taken six credits of your breadth requirements . you have one botany class and one chemistry class . and political science . so that is nine credits . did you take english composition 201 ?
do you have any skirt that will go with this sweater ?
there is not much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they are designed for serious runner
no , they live alone .
yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . and there you go .
there is a man-made fishing pond nearby . so , what do you think of going fishing there ?
that depends . some semesters have many , some do not . and some courses do not have exams but only ask for papers . that is easy .
how can we keep track of our grades ?
i have searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ?
i still need to take english 201 , but i really do not like writing .
ok ! i will show you how my mom did it .
take your pick , julie .
they should have then listed on their resumes .
how is everything ?
i get it now .
ok , every one asks their parents let them stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning .
i love apple pie too .
sorry . i will clean it up .
why do not you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything i have ?
so how to apply for a job on the internet ?
that is right .
ok . i understand .
of course there is . the top-level coaches there are from the state sports general administration .
congratulations ! that is really exciting ! let is get out a bottle of wine to celebrate !
you are always responsible and careful .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on-line .
next time you come back , bring your id .
math , sheath . what is the evidence ?
do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ?
i am pretty sure that i did not send that claim form in .
it is ok .
sure , what would you like ?
until two in the morning . but you do not have to stay that long . well ? what about it ?
so he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it .
we will get the factory to meet your requirements .
i am fine . thank you .
is there anything else ? how about my salary ?
i am afraid not , we are very short-staffed at the moment . can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? perhaps tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
just roll it up and have a bite , amy .
what kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
our silks are known for their quality . they are one of our traditional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . they are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand .
the pay must be good .
thanks . i appreciate that .
where did you lose it ? maybe i can help you to find it .
that sounds perfect . thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me mr . parsons .
do you say prayers before dinner ?
i know how to gather and summarize information from the intent , which is an essential skill for market analysis .
i am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests .
i really appreciate that .
is this the one you want ?
that is right . however , players can only pass the ball backwards . they cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . that is a foul .
sure ! that would be great ! are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
oh , i am really sorry .
yes , mary ?
tom , that lucky guy .
the small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . i wonder if your pastry tastes better .
no , i am a tourist . this place is amazing ! it is much bigger than i imagined , and much more exciting ! there is so much to see here .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do , those are less expensive .
believe it or not , the company i worked for closed down , so i am out of a job .
thank you . i will go through it and tell you .
that is better , but it is still not quite right .
i am sorry , ma ' am . our general manager is not in town . but i would be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . but i am afraid that he will say the same thing . we have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . and now if you will excuse me , i will go and find our assistant manager for you .
ok , let is move on !
i am afraid not . why do not you call the help desk ? someone there will be able to help you .
15 days . the transportation by air will take five days .
i see . have a look at this one . it is very cheap because it is not very durable .
i cannot accept your excuse . it is five of the clock .
you did , but i cannot help it .
i would like to say goodbye to you .
hmm . is that true ?
no ... not really . the sad thing is that i was not there when she died . i really wanted to be there one last time .
it is really nice of you . thanks !
yes , someone will be here to let you in .
well ! you like sea food ?
i do not care , it is school in the morning .
for four days or so .
as you please . i am ready .
well , that explains it . i have been using my old pin number ! thanks for explaining everything to me .
how do you like your coffee ?
let me take your temperature first .
well , i have always wanted to see vancouver . i have heard it has the most beautiful views .
but there is not a single one right now .
you know , next week , we will hold a football match . our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it
things are going well for me , dr . smith .
i am not sure which would be better for me buying some insurance or putting my money in a savings deposit .
sure ! let is have some nachos and mozzarella sticks .
well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . but according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free . you will have to pay duty for the other one .
did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?
the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . and the length depends on the particular situation .
i will call my friend now . you call yours .
i spent a year to get my license .
check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake .
it does not matter .
look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it is probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but , it is probably not a good idea to keep it up i am willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
no , my company makes cameras . well , i am also a photographer , but two of these are for our display .
i mean in the library , or in some information center . often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions .
but you know if he brought it or not , right ?
how did you start writing ?
yes . the porter will go and help you .
can you help me move this table ?
yes , of course .
yes , it is so popular that it is sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores .
i think this summer is a good time to visit berlin . it is a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .
well , really ! that was wonderful ! i felt no pain at all . thank you , doctor .
nothing . i have told you before that i will not go to the party and that is flat .
you can knock off another 2 for that .
chicago university . my major is economics .
what kind are you thinking of getting ?
sure , if you show me your passport .
55 dollars , madam .
ok . i will make enquiries .
i am informed that many people used short messages to pay a new year call , and only on the spring festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , did not it ?
sure , i have had the steak and the lobster before . they are both very good .
oh . i am sorry . but is this 321-9987 ?
yeah , i crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time .
oh , how long ?
what do you do ?
there is a laundry form as well as a bag in your room . pls fill it out and the maid will come pick it up .
yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . your fever will be gone in a day or two .
so go then .
everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it is the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they are not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life .
we have french and thousand island .
early next month . in the meantime , i should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . i hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my l cb
i am sorry to hear that . what is the matter ?
do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ?
ok . well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . who are you trying to call ?
uh , i can see that . and erica falls has lost a lot of weight .
oh , i am a little busy these days .
yes . i would like to make a reservation to new york for 18th next month .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
one thousand eight hundred yuan .
it is amazing . and when did he begin to play in the nba ?
here is the application form . i also need to see your student id and your permission letter from the university .
i am very happy to meet you . you are from the united states , are not you ?
how much will it be for the pass ?
i really appreciate your help .
no , but she told me to telephone her next week .
she is a nurse .
well , that is only $ 4000 . did not you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? where is the rest of the money ?
ok , it will not happen again .
thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . you have been doing some great work .
oh , i have got an idea . why do not you ask dad to go with you ? he badly needs some exercise .
i have received some special training in typing , shorthand and operating a fax machine , etc .. i am experienced in ibm-pc . i can operate familiarly a word-processor , a fax machine , a photo and other office equipment .
sure . in the middle part of the fifth street , there is a phoenix restaurant . maybe you can go there .
three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
16 hours . beijing is 16 hours ahead .
it is forty-five yuan .
great , how are you ?
one thousand u . s . dollars .
sure , just a moment . ... i am sorry no one answer the phone .
there is no need to do like this . we can surf the net and find some templates for resume .
it could not be better . my husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much .
ok . anything else ?
well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ?
thanks . would you give me another favor ?
i am going to england by flight b . e . 987 .
can i read it when you are done ?
sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way .
not at all . it was a pleasure . perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
would you like to call home ?
ok , i will get someone to phone you first thing in the morning .
yes , they are different because they are printed by the ministry of finance in set amounts . just 100 rib , 500 rib and 1,000 rib , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see .
now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me , miss , how much will i have to pay for all of this .
i hope you do . and keep in touch , ok ?
all right . we will have some seafood and vegetables .
no , i will be right back .
that might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . what about free delivery ? if we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ?
that is what you get for working in a male-dominated field . i think you will find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . you probably will not be able to change him .
any cigarettes or liquor ?
that does not sound like a great present .
well , what is the operator is number ?
oh , yes !
what about veggies ?
what do you mean ? we are talking now , are not we ?
i am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible .
sorry , mr . smith agenda is full today .
actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . you can do it over the phone or the internet .
no problem . anything else , sir ?
is that all , your majesty ?
oh , yes , i like that one , but it is too heavy .
then you will need small change .
is there any pain now ?
oh , do you enjoy it ?
sure . i am j mcquillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 .
that is all right .

oh , you may call him uncle , or henry .

take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again .
ok . please sit down . i hope you will be satisfied with our service .
ok . wait a minute .
my name is blanca .
that is a problem .
you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . you already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music .
it is not even noon yet .
what is the big deal ? it is just a picture of some woman .
it is saturday , a great weekend .

maybe next weekend . she only mentioned this before she left .
so , how was your trip to thailand ?
we look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations .
did not anyone stop them ?
well , maybe .
i like it . naturally it can arouse your feelings .
excellent . well , what other questions do you have rebecca ?
no . i will not let you ride a bicycle late at night .
what is that ? it gets the name from the festival itself . that is really funny !
i would not mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you .
oh , that is my stop . how much do i need to pay ?
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . do not worry . nothing bad will happen . i will even buy your ticket for you .
no , i think it is very boring . can you change it to channel twelve , please ?
yes , you too . thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account . my associate , susan kim , should be here any minute . would you like something to drink while we are waiting ?
that is not bad . it could be a short-term alternative . your mum can look for another one when the market improves . things will work out eventually .

there are such shops living on selling parts . i do not like their service either . all they want is your money . but in the long run , they will be losing costumers . anyway , car service business is new in china . we all have to control what they are doing . otherwise , they will not improve .

a young french fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , when i fastened the cord and walked to the platform , i was extremely nervous . when i looked down , i was nervous even more . if the cord had broken , i would be knocked to bake meat . however , i knew my worries were unwanted . i was afraid if i retreated others might say something about me . i had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . i only felt wind wiring at my ears . my body rapidly descended . i thought that after only seven or eight seconds i was rebounded to upper air by the cord . in fact it was 30 seconds . maybe because of my nervousness , i only felt seven or eight seconds . when rebounding to the high altitude , i felt a sudden sense of relief . i did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable .
two books at a time . except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library .

i have often wondered the same thing . i also wonder who reads them . then i realize that i am standing here reading them myself .
i am afraid so . sometimes i feel hot and sometimes i feel cold .
we will have to discuss the problem later .
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
why ? what is wrong with it ?
it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you would be different .
the rubik is cube is so difficult to solve that i think it should be banned !
sure . here you are .
it is a football game the school team plays at home . the dance and reunions are usually that night , too .
i do not know . my wife used to speak french . i must tell her to brush it up .
just so-so . where did you get it ?
no , i think i should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam .
oh , thank you . your skirt looks beautiful , too .
i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
you have been so helpful . thank you .
i am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others .
yes , i am young , and unmarried . it is no problem for me to travel frequently .
look behind us at the mountains ! they are reflecting pink !
if you buy me a ticket i will go with you for sure !

peaches make me break out , but i do not have any other allergies .

it does not matter .
yes , i would like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
hi , dad . where are you ?

it is an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group .
may i have a look at that china tea set ? it is extremely beautiful .
it is too bad that i could not make it . who won ?
how many nights a week is it ?
now you are talking . that sounds good . what is it ?
the core values are credibilities , team work , diligence and devotion .
you can find anything ! are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? once you step into this world , there is no turning back !
wow that is great news ! they are a great couple !
i sure do . how about american express ?
actually , it suggest english . the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , india , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , and japan so beginning again
i have only a few friends .
that is a lot to sell with very low profit margins .

yes . if you want to order room service , just press 0 on your phone , and that will connect you with the front desk .
now there we are in agreement !
why do not you go to the english corner to talk to your classmates in english quite often ?
only old women like that .
i do not know . something rotten here ?
i think that that would be a really good choice ! let is call and make a reservation .
nice to meet you , too .
since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there should not be any problems for the contract .
why do you think it was not higher than that ?
who cares ? she is pretty .
haha ! i actually think that many locals would disagree with you they are all dying to be paid in us dollars .
i will be there after 20 minutes .
it is about fifteen minutes ' walk . that is all .
yes , i have the tour guide certificate .
there are a few in my country . we have deposit of gold , but they are very small .

i am sorry , i did not catch what you said . could you repeat it please ?
i have much time . i suppose it can be done .
i am afraid it was not . and when the police get here , you will also see that it was not . but enough of this bickering . i am going to go find a phone . do not move that arm while i am gone . alright ?
i do not know . will you forgive me ?
yes , how much is it ?
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
i am sure you will look grand when it is done . would you like to have a shampoo after a while ?
i am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
you are going to have to pay late fees .
shall we go to the tiananmen square first ?
that is strange . but probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' getting to know you more personally ' . what about your answers ?
really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
yes , what size do you want ?
i am sure it is broken .
you would better get on with your homework ! you can practice on sunday .
thanks , doc . i have got a really bad toothache ! i cannot eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . i think it might be my wisdom tooth .

yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . are all the terms here satisfactory ?
oh , i see , sir . well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
well , maybe they have got a point . i mean , i suspect that they think the same about us .
what about this ?
i have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so i would like to commence at had 2,500 a month .
ok . next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 am . at 12 am , back here for lunch .
would it cost a lot more ?
my wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch . some of my wife is jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe .
why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that .
are you feel tired ?
let is just say i screwed up more than my econ class .
i have no idea . tell me .
first , i need a letter of recommendation .
that seems like an awful waste ! why do not people order fewer dishes so that they do not have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ?
i am engaged in accounting .
it washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system .
why not ? i would like to buy some candies . since there are so many people , i think they must have delicious candy .
she is really pretty .
not really . when i was little , we did not really listen to music at all .
so what was the score ?
we can check it and hand carry the small bags . and we have to open each for inspection .
yes . that is for today . thank you .
you should telephone the garage for help .
not a problem . but may i just inform you that we have introduced a new service called account renewing upon maturity ?
i have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional .
yeah . i really like lesley .
i guess he gets that from me , i never did well in math when i was a kid . what can i do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .
that is a good idea .
i am making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . i should not , of course , make a change for less . could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ?
but i need a pretty decent job . i need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
you should be optimistic about this . things have taken a good turn . you should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible .
that is the second branch hotel of hilton . walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . turn left , i believe , you will get it .
oh , that is a good idea . perhaps i should have a try .
yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . you had to be there ! everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious !
now i come back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pendant is broken , i am afraid .
how long will you be staying ?
what else do i need to do ?
it sounds like you are coming down with something .
what is next ?
the car is beautiful , is not it ? come on inside and we will discuss the price .
but it isupposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon .
yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should i prepare ?
i will just have to wait for ucla .
generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . we offer our new employees a one-week training course .
now i remember . we met at a conference in tokyo last year .
yes , we are hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . mostly people are pretty happy about it ... i guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force .
that may be what i am going to do .
maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
pleased meet you , too , mr . dou .
what if this small fever turns into a big fever ?

it was really nice talking to you too .
she will be online 20 minutes after she opens the box .
the kitchen god ? what does he do ?
we will be there ! thanks for the help !
right . since my work is near a park , it is a really nice ride , too .
of course . one of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . no one can match us so far as quality is concerned .
what is over ?
oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
i mean internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . for example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study or some bad guys steal people is money online , etc .
shame on you !
do you like nba ?
no , we did not . i guess you are right . we should patch things up .
i am glad you are enjoying it .
no problem at all . with this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ?
it has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
that is interesting and logical i guess . in my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people do not really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that .
it is leap my mind . i really feel terrible about it .
he constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . i doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
ok , i am in . when do i start ?
no , this is not gonna happen ! i ... i have ruined everything ...
i am sorry . all the appointments are filled .
do you want me to help you ?
that would be me !

oh , yes . i like that one . but it is too heavy .

i am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
we want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots .
oh , thank you . but how do you spell it ?

we can have it to you at that time .
well , that is too far . can you change some money for me ?

i have never tasted that . i would like to have a try today .
i am afraid i do not . i am quite new in town .
would you please make it for a single person ?
is there a big selection of organic foods at whole foods ?
i will pick you up here tomorrow .
i do not think so . i have been following her around campus and i have not seen another guy .
he really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .
they were not too bad . i really liked my poli-sci class .
that is true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
thanks , miss . wang .
well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast .
of course . we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .
oh , it is the latest novel by ray blue . it is a sic-fi thriller .
yes , he was . i am not imagining it . finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he did not smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i am so scared . can i call the police ?
have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?
i am planning to return to china after graduation .
oh , what a shame . only sleeping cars have tickets . others are all out of stock . the price of the sleeping car is almost the same as the airplane . you see , the discount plane tickets are no more than 500 yuan . a good deal , is not it ?
i see . ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ?
well , when you do your darks , can you wash some of mine too ?
oh , really ?
no . you should not drive like that .
i would if i could .
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm in china . hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! you should not stab them vertically into the rice bow !
here you are .
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone is got a sublet .
this is gonna be a great barbecue !

yes , but not fluently .
i have been completely out of touch with my old friends .
including your name , sex , date of birth , height , phone number , and so on .
well , i hope it all works out , john . i think if you are part of the team , things will go well . but you know we would all miss you here . so i will not say i am happy to think that you are leaving .

it is a bit loose . do you have a middle size ?
what is the matter ?
here you are . is everything ok ?
yes , my uncle is firm had an office in one of the towers .

so , if i do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a corporate agreement savings plan with you ?

one of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . i have seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . i have had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . as far as weaknesses , i really enjoy my work , and sometimes i put in too much time . but by being aware of my tendency to overwork , i have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime .
it is great . although his father did not agree with that , tom went through with it .
this must be his 21st birthday . no doubt about it .
could you tell me my account balance ? my account number is ...
could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ?
really ? then what do you do with it ?
i understand that . but i think maybe it is not a date . you are taking the matter too much to heart .
what did you order ?
thank you very much .
generally from the college
it is just a slogan for a famous company there is nothing really special about it .
i like fish . please bring me an order of that .

you will cook it of course !
oh , jared ! i cannot wait for our wedding ! i hope you do not mind , but i have already chosen a date ! six months from now in the summer ! melissa saw you buying the ring last month so i have had plenty of time to start planning !

a meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff .
no , i will have to get an add sheet .
by the way , i heard kitty is just got in a shipment of jamaican blue mountain .
i see . i guess i should be more careful about what i read , especially on the internet where you have no idea who anybody is .
you have got a point there . it is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . there is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . it might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea .
so why not come and join us ? lee will come as well .
i do ! my favorites are mexican , thai , and indian .

i will catch you later then . have a wonderful morning .
it was nice talking to you too .
do you have any certificates on computer ?
no , of course not . but i am not able to do my work and neither are you .
okay . i will write up the paperwork .
yeah , she is broken up about it , poor kid .
maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier .
do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
hmm . as i mentioned , i can work well under pressure and i enjoy work that challenges me . i think that my english ability is also a strong point .
oh , really ? i went to china last winter !
you are the one i should thank . you have done really great job .
yes . i am capable of speaking english smoothly . i have been learning english for years .
certainly . and what vegetables would you like ?

i would like to make my plea .

at 16: 35 , from platform 8 .
that is all right . maybe we can make another arrangement .
well , i do not have the guts to ask her out .
may i have headphones for the in-flight movie ?
that is a good reason to like something .
be careful , tom . those are pretty heavy .
i think i need a thorough check-up .
could it be the battery ?
i am afraid that i am very ill .
oh ! it means that i am going to take only a few clothes , so i did not have to carry a heavy suitcase .
no . but if you say something like that in the white house , they may take it seriously . sometimes i think you joke too much .
there are many famous resorts in egypt . you can have a good time here .
sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said ' everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '

you want some souvenirs !
yes , i will find one for you . here you are . it is made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft .
thank you very much .
i am no better than them . they say it is mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but i think it is stimulating .
why not go again to celebrate our one year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
the news reported that four stores were broken into .

i like those too .

oh ... by the way , i saw you with your daughter at the office christmas party . she is really beautiful !
i went to paris .
you are welcome .

nothing rang a bell .
there is a lot to see there . perhaps we should go tomorrow .
do we get a day off from school then ?
ok . i will go and get a pair of them .
i got it for parking in the red zone .
oh , thank you kindly .
friendliness and a good attitude are also very important .
yes . i bought it in johnson thrift store .

well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
i think it looks gorgeous .

you can get a loan from the bank . you know lpf program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases .
do not forget to call us if you are in tokyo .
let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . i have more free time then .
and i would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from japan . it is the japanese that have made it a fad .
can i get you anything to drink ? :
you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .
we should do this more often .

take it easy . when we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . but now you are putting on some weight .
i had an idea .
yeah , i know , but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they will not like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
i remember , sir , that your friend took the bill . you did not pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
that is right . vince still stops by her office every day to thank her .
i will do my best , but sometimes i have trouble being myself in stressful situations .

i am going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
here you go , thanks for everything .
it should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . all together our tour should last about half an hour .

well , we hit it off with each other . nothing more , nothing much .
the current rate is 50 dollars per night .
well , you will see . with this new watch , i can go anywhere , do anything .
maybe not . i think we should just focus on the retired people .
what is the matter ?
good . i will just stay here until you get back .
why is that ?
good , here is your ticket and four dollars change .

we were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so ay new employees .
oh , you do ?
so you will come , will not you ?
i understand . so , what would you like to do with the balance ?
where do we submit the tender ?
how did you pay them ?
have you had any experience as a guide ?
do you think i should lie in bed ?
he tried to leave with the money .

i do not believe that .
yes , sir . may i have your laundry ticket please ?
yes , i do . leave me alone !

i do not know . i did not really feel like going out . i guess i am feeling a little homesick .
which season do you like best ?
thank you very much .
what do i do after that ?
well , tell me . how was the labor and delivery ?
i eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods .
oh , i see , since i am a heavy smoker . may i change my seat ?
i do not see any damage .
i will be back again next wednesday .
are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ?
is it a four-door or a two-door ?
go on . take a chance . you could just hint at your idea . the client should be smart enough to take a hint .
yes , she gets along with them quite well .
no , i probably need to do some more research .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday cheer you up .
how much is the fine ?
keep lying down . the matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration .
did you have to pay a deposit ?
i bet that you wish you had not done that .

yeah , and i love your cooking .
hello , i am calling from beijing . i would like to reserve a double room with a bath from tonight on for five days , please .
are there any people who speak english ?
on the other hand , i think the other team won everyone is respect . the leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool .
generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . the only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . the shelf life is longer for these products .
it says the book is on the shelf , but i did not find it there .
is that so ? i did not know it . can i possible borrow a jacket and a tie ?
i wonder if i can charge this call to my hotel room .
i am usually drinking all night long . at least 10 drinks .

i think someone is stalking me .
the bulls , of course !
no , thank you .
these postcards are great . i want to buy a dozen with different pictures .
i cannot help it .
well , one year would be fine , too . i am not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
most people think that wealth means success . but from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . on the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . the ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. with the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . and in toda s society , if you have money , you seem to have everything . but this is not the case . i think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . it also means that you can get respect from others .
do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
that leak is a problem for my water bill .
all you really need to know is that the apartment looks great .

i guess so . i do not have any other questions . should i sign here then ?
me , too . i have heard so much about you .
i understand . and are there other bonuses included ?
good ! here , let me help you with your bag . is it your first time to seattle ? i would be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you are up to it .
look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you are watching . filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not .
ok . thank you very much .
i highly recommend you quit soon . the longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit .
hold on a second , please . i will see if he is in . i am sorry , mr . baker had just gone out . who is calling ?
thank you , mr . smith . i am returning to china today .
what about this ?
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person cannot live alt by himself , i think . a friend in need is a friend indeed . so the more really close friends i have , the better .
well , thank you very much .
it goes all the way there .
i am the project manager so i have to make sure our projects run smoothly . i work with three project engineers . they take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it will last and the better it will look . what color do you want the suit to be ?
yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discour
what is the matter ?
why not listen to music online ?
oh , how do you to mr . white ? my name is li ming , here is my card .
that is a good idea . when did you buy it ? is it a name brand ?
not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck is back !
how are the clubs different in japan than in london ?
i do not know . never saw him before . why ?
can i have some cookies first , please ?
yeah , but i can speak english , too .
that is marketing research ... but what about getting started once you have an idea ?
where did you go ?
perhaps i could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
can i have an aisle seat , pls .
that is nice . do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?
fine , we will be expecting you then .
well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .
it is not too bad , but it is pretty cold here too . i heard it is going to be a little warmer tomorrow .
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
no , just bring yourself . i hope to see you there .
because in history , the chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation .
that would be a good shot . can you take my picture here , dear ? please try to get the garden in the frame as well .
but in my case , the fact matches the theory . mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . it frightens me !
we usually go to the cafeteria .
maybe that is why your english is much better than my chinese .
are you sure ? all the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods .
a cup of coffee and an apple pie . how about you ?
sure , my name is ana ferris . do not worry about it , it happens to me all the time . i am terrible with names too .

sure our thing .
maybe i have got a higher eq . i am not sure .
i want to open another account .
mom ! ! ! please . all my friends have had it for years .
i know what you mean .
i think that maybe i should accept their offer .
what ? you are overcharging me !
that would be great .
wait . we have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed .
good luck to you , good-bye .
men are like that you know . they can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness .
no , i do not suppose he is to blame . the man in the other car made a mistake .
it makes me feel rather shabby . that woman has a good taste in dressing , i would say .
here you go ?
thanks a lot ! i will definitely do that . is there anything else ?
i see . thank you very much .
yes , but i do not think they are enough for me .
of course . i will try to buy some things at the asian grocery down the block too . then i can do a little cooking in my apartment .
private collectors ! oh , they must have excellent collections . i will go and see each of them . what kinds of collections can i see ? come on , david , do not keep me in suspense !

you are kidding !
yes . put them on there please .
yes , so they are no longer being sold .
yes , i am sure i have done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
i need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
she is kind of short .
yeah well it is about time ! he is been living with his parents for 40 years !
i am not too scared . but i have done sky diving before .
i guess you will never forget today .
it is fun walking around them , but their displays are so good i am tempted to buy things i do not really need .
that sounds like a good idea . it looks very big though .
did he do something wrong ?
now i came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pen is broken , i am afraid .
just let me weigh it for you . that is 2 lb . and 6 oz . that is be 10 .
why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
a small glass , or a big one ?
well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife .

good choice ! but , what is your favorite kind of hard liquor ?
just a minute . i need to make a list of thinks that we need .
are you more a follower or a leader ?
getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important . if you smoke , you need to stop .
is this amount correct ?
i wish i could find one just like it .
yeah , everyday . and there is only one choice . all the other buses are going the other direction .
it is mild , but it is not always pleasant . the weather is often cold in the north and windy in the east . it is often wet in the west and sometimes warm in the south .
ok , i will just check out a few other stores .
i do not like it . i am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . above all , i hate talking to those poker faces everyday .
it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .
yes , i have booked a room for 24th . it is a double room .
i see . i am from taiwan , so i know regular characters better than simplified .
hey-how about the cinema club ?
yeah , i know that . but at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you do not bargain hard , you will get ripped-off .
yeah . i am really looking forward to it .
we can sleep together .
your sister is in high school now no one plays the piano at home .
i like pcc better .
that sounds fine to me .
then would you please go to a dance party with me ?

good afternoon , mr . brown . my name is mrs . anderson , manager of the sales department .
i see . he is usually here on tuesday mornings ...
what kind of grapes do you want ?
i am on it !
this job pays sixty-five thousand dollars per year .

yes . this is room 804 . i cannot find my coat . i was wondering if it is in the lost and found .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?

what do you mean too late ?
ok , here you are .
what ? that is too much .
in the suburb . how are you and carol ? still living in town ?
i apologize . this should not have to be this way .
quite right . and unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . it is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance .
let is keep in touch .
i am serious .
then we will have to put up with it .
i guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum .
good coming , sir . may i do your room now ?
i am sure you will .
do you feel better now ?
never mind . i will be waiting for you .
what--is tomorrow night something special ?

i hear what you are saying , and i wish there were something i could do .
yes . do you have a pharmacy here , please ?
oh , it is unbelievable !
oh , yes . you ?
yes , i had taken finance courses in a training school . compound talents are needed in the society and i must study continually to keep abreast with the times .
that is right . i have not done that yet .
there are twenty rolls in a bowl . you can get another bowl for free if there are not enough rolls .
so , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . then we could go to a club . we have not been to one for ages .
she never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others .
i envy her and also i hate her at the same time .
here is an interesting ad
we plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates .

those were the good old days , sir , indeed .
how much do you think the rent will be ?

i am moblogging !
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
i wonder if we can change the temperature .
ok . it sounds fine .
his girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her .
i do not think i have the discipline for that .
yes , so that is an extra 6 for both of us .
all right , we will do an investigation .
they are neat . now let is take that path into the woods and see what we can see ...
fill out this exchange memo , please .
it is often cold in december , january and february . it snows sometimes .
what is the gate number ?
well , in that case , that is fine . i want a first class ticket on thursday .

did you like your work ?
yes , ms . reese . i remember , you spoke with me . is there a problem ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
she is the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year .
i have no idea . it was completely out of the blue .
here we go .
well , do you have through tickets ?
just think of it as a hobby . then it is actually fun .
well , that is something i have never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty .
it is much better now . thank you .
so you have acquainted yourself with the company . it is refreshing to interview someone who is sure of what they want .
you owe $ 235 . 13 in fees .
the only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is zina .
yes , this is julianne horton , and i am calling to arrange an appointment with ms . mcneal .

the wall colors totally suit the style of this house .

you can never tell . he might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it .
i appreciate your help .
what are we going to do now ?
there is no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great .
well , the type b account is very restricted . if your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your settlement account , i would recommend the type a account for you .
you are kidding ! i cannot believe you have been standing this entire time and did not say anything .

usually about two month .
i am more than happy having her in my class .
oh , sorry to bother you . i want to know what kind of meat it is .
glad to meet you . mr stewart . i am the guide from pacific tour agency . my name is zhang hua .
moblogging ? what does that mean ?
i am afraid we cannot agree to that . we concluded the business with you here in houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in new york . we wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from new york or seattle . hong kong is out of the question .
well , there are two hilton hotels around here . which one is your destination ?
sure . please come this way .
hi , i am susan marshall . you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
good ! how much is it ?

how about your mother ?
i had a few coffees while i was waiting . let is get out of here !

i know that he will .
what about cigarettes or cigars ?
the total charge is $ 15 .
would you have time to go look at apartments with me ?
that is a big order , jane . i am really swamped .
well , i still cannot adjust to the fast pace of city life .
at six thirty am tomorrow .
oh , lots of things . mostly training new people .
i should still tell him . in the least , i can refer him to my company . it might help .
here you are .
you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
well . in that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . thank you all the same .
uh-oh . it will probably cost a lot to fix it .
it is just around the corner
no , thank you .
it might be sore for a while . you will be ok . now let is go home and rest .
i register this friday .
that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .

how long will the system be down for ?

no . which one do you recommend ?
no , i am open to suggestions .
i can lend you some money .
well , this might be silly . but i just cannot get him off my mind . and i cannot help missing him .
ok , here we go .
the sale price today is $ 1 each .
yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . however , let me take a close look at the final draft .
i would not say that . it looks fine to me .
they are in the cabinet above the dishwasher .
it is a beautiful drive .
yes . here you are .
how long will it take ?
three years . they have been dating since freshman year . they are even talking about marriage .
of course , that is something really irritating . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . and then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
hello , i called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . sorry , i just have a couple more questions .
you like to communicate with him ?
your best is not good enough . back in my day , i would clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it would be twice as clean as this sty !
of course i do !
well , okay . then there is still michael . but he is the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely will not be michael .
i am not sure . what is the difference between them ?
an automatic sedan .
what water wagon ?
i prefer my margarita on the rocks , please .
so how long does it take ?
she does not appear to be headed this way , so i will go get the check .
we have named her alice after my wife is grandmother .
and what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
sure , here they are .
how does friday sound ?
the fourth . i will send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
it is true . i would never go there again either . country music is a nightmare . so is it the latin club ?
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
would you like fries with that ?
yes , honey . go to your room , and take out your book . it is your reading time now .
please try these on .
yes , i did . i have them here .
let is move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i will lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
really ? i will also try to speak slowly . how would you arrange the guests iseats , jane ?
do you need every color in the rainbow ?
i feel confused about the grammars .
i want to feel that i am making a real contribution to the company , so i would like my boss to trust me with important work .
i called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what i wanted !
let me think about it for a minute . let is see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it will come to me .
sure , where are you ?
it is a quarter to eight . i am going to work .
that is really surprising . i always thought they are well matched . what about the kids ? who get custody ?
all right . wait a minute .
well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense . mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they are hungry .
you will find that by the paper towels .
you know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved .
ok chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while i listen to your chest ? you really are all bunged up , you do not sound too good at all . ok , i am going to set you up with a bunch o
as soon as you purchase your traveller is cheques from us , you are covered . no matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . all we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . we will need that number if you need to make a claim .
here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair .
yes , we have a great variety of chinese antiques .
i did not sleep much last night .
let is close the deal at $ 4800 , ok ?
how long before i find out what their decision is ?
is there anything after the meeting ? in that case , would you add one plan ? i want to visit our guest mr . ross after the meeting . can you arrange it for me ?
i stayed with my friends .
oh , that is good . i guess the caddies were pleased .
it is a suitcase . but i have forgot the exact color . maybe it is red or something .
really ? perhaps i should listen to classical music often . i heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .
he is too scared to ask her .
very impressive . and i do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
i realize that , but i am not guilty .
good . right , that comes to $ 1,500 .
usually , we give a commission of 4 to our agents .
i am catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning .
i think i should be more careful next time .
how about sunday then ?
did you go to school here ?
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long-distance running ?
yeah , right here .
oh , photography , it is really a good hobby .
i see . you people from south prefer sweet , do not you ?
none that i can think of .
i am afraid we are sticking to our choice .
thank you . please confirm your information and sign your name in the blank .
you know what ? i do not really need the money . thanks anyways !
it sure would . did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? she had horrible posture !
well , then i do not think this would be a good apartment for me . thank you anyway .
hi , mr . wang , what can i help you with ?
actually , you can only have four .
yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
yes , i know .
that is fine ! how would you like this cash back ?
well , i do not think i can manage with it .
oh , it is a pity .
supervisor . open the door .
could i interest you in anything else ?
are you sure ?
is that right ? it sure beats the old one ?
no , not yet . why ?
well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .
all right . let is call it quits and go home .
this situation is not easy to handle .
you might even dream about dinner .
sorry , i do not know , there is something wrong with my watch .
ok . what are your strong points ?
dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can .
so , you also like coffee ?
what i cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk .
i will pick you up by nine of the clock and take you straight to the airport .
that is great . if you do not mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ?
do you want small bills or large ?
all right . i will take the room .
some even do make-up slightly . are you aware that previous ismall potato ' ma xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?
i got a character part some old lady who shows up in a few scenes .
just some water , please . do you have any ointment for my nose ? it feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much .
i guess it is mrs hill . she sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband is misconduct with his secretary .
is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? you see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . it is about 2,400 kilograms .
have you ever been a student cadre ?
just a minute . it is ten to nine by my watch .
where should i put them up ?
what will they be asking me on that form ?
ok then . well , i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday .
because i am very competent in this area .
what about grapes and water melons ?
why ? we just got here .
uh huh . how about a used car ? they have got good ones now .
mr . : why do not you sit behind brad ?
i want to have a try later .
ok . i will be happy to join you .
that sounds good . i will call you once i arrive .
do you have a reservation ?
would you like some coffee or tea ?
good idea . how about a cup of coffee ?
that is fine . i will do that then .
not yet , but i have to soon . he is eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night
which train is that ? which platform does it leave from ?
how about the dessert ?
i like it .
i have a feeling they are about to go down in a few days .
sure , my credit card number is ...
well , the newspaper is over there . look in the want ads , but i do not know what you are going to find without a college degree .
it is been a week , and i have not slept that well .
my mother taught me some tricks of the trade . i have always loved jewelry .
fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup !
i am sorry , but you got on the wrong bus .
i am glad to meet you , mr . song .
you mean you did not get the job because you are a woman ?
we could always wait for the next bus to come .
i think that might work for me as well .
you will find a taxi stand the street corner .
i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first , it is good for your health . i am afraid it is not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . you might as well sleep out for a longer hour .
thank you for calling . i really appreciate your kindness . but right now , i am very busy preparing for an interview of another company . i do not think i am available for this opportunity .
oh , i am sorry to hear that , sir . what exactly is problem ?
yes , i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself .
because you are my dear wife .
i am not going to be able to do that .
yeah ! but you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . maybe tomorrow is a clear day . who knows ?
ok , see you next time .
well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of mexico . you seem to be interested in that part of the world .
i wish i could , but i am busy . i am going to work at a soup kitchen tonight .
that is fantastic . i think i like this one .
i do not care how much it costs . i am rolling in it .
what do we have for the dinner now ?
the rent is $ 1500 per month .
i do not like all your questions . that is why .
chinese medicine is strange . the patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more .
congratulations ! that is wonderful . i bet both of you are quite happy .
yes , please let him know i would like to discuss the girard case with him .
i am sorry , i am just too excited and forget it . can i look it through ?
so what do you do with all the out-dated issues ?
i think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves .
hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i am sorry .
i am quite outgoing , i think .
i do not think it smells nice .
will you travel by sea or by air ?
be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
how can you do that ?
yes , show me your tickets please .
i am here on business .
what about your parking spot ?
thank you , mr . smith . goodbye .
are you serious ? why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? does not your company have a pretty good corporate image ? i will bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...
we have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls . the brand name is nokia .
okay , but i have not prepare supper .
but what if something happened to them ? what would happen to my money ?
i am a firm united supporter . i like their playing style . the reds always have several excellent wing-backs , like riggs , peckham and gary neville . they often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .
because i want to change my working environment and seek new challenges .
where was this picture taken ?
that is all right , i am a beginner . i have just learnt how to play .
um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . he was ... amazing !
well , i just came in . i worked overtime yesterday . some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . so i stayed to double check them . the boss was aware of my very late work of last night . so before he left office , he told me i could come one hour later this morning .
is this where we will be holding the meeting ?
sure you can . several of the banks in london , such as the national westminster bank and barclays bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . they will do so against our sales confirmation or contract .
yes . you know i have been cooking more kind of food recently and i needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .
you look so upset . what is going on ?
yeah , and it is bigger than ours was .
would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ?
i see , we have an explanation left on the table . if you follow the direction , it is quite simple .
would you have any necklace that would go well with this ?
i went to see it the day it came out .
thank you very much .
i graduated with honors . i had a 3 . 9 .
not at all , but you get what you pay for .
serves you right .
oh , yeah , the brand name .
it is in the eyes . they are the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy .
of course . i did not know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ?
ten or about five minutes . you will be all set .
i am interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . do you have any ideas ?
ok . that sounds easy enough . have you called any of them yet ?
how often dose this bus go there ?
we need a detention warrant .
yeah , i think i will .
oh , i see them . some are doing taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the chinese wushu .
i thought you were the only child in the family . did not china practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?
baby , come on . do not do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! do not leave me .
yes . sometimes i can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . and i often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
well , how many dogs do they train at a time ?
i learned back in high school .
it is picture association of the concept that the professor taught today .
i like diet sprite . does that have any caffeine in it ?
i will tell peter to bring your key to your apartment right away .
it is a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking .
you see , that is what i am talking about , i cannot stand your sarcastic jokes anymore .
the service this evening has kind of sucked . is that our server over there ?
cockroaches have declared war on my room !
well there is an important meeting with a new client .
what should i take first ?
sounds like it was meant to be .
let is give them a hand .
the weather is gorgeous here .
so what do you think it is ?
yes , i hear about it every time she comes here .
never ! but thank you for inviting me .
that is fine . i will be waiting for you .
so , what are you going to do ?
yes . the board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce .
you were spying on me , were not you ? you probably rented those children .
it sounds ok . then how do you pay the commission ?
no kidding ! i am 16 , too . we should definitely play together some time . my name is bob .
then why did not you talk to me ?
four by six will do .
i swear , i am going to kill you for this .
what would you like for appetizer and dinner ?
i would like to book a table for five at 7: 00 tonight .
no . it is free .
do not mention it .
are you interested in today is special ?
i do not like to make friends with people who are not honest . honesty is very important to me .
my printer is broken . can you print up a copy for me ?
salary is , admittedly , important , but i will care more about what i can learn from the job .
i felt the same at first . later he told me that i would better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . but back in china , helping others is always regarded being kind .
oh , right . what time is it there ?
no , this is her sister , nancy .
the round shape pair ?
i am very grateful . how much will it be ?
no , but we went to the kennedy center .
that is fine . i want to pay in cash . here is the money .
we do many things . in the morning , we go swimming and boating . in the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . we sit around a camp fire at night . we sing or tell stories .
oh , sorry .
how is that ?
ahh ! now that is more like it . atmosphere !
for me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i would not ever have to share .
it is better because it does not tie up the phone .
you refused the gift ? that is terrible .
hang in there . the hardest part is just about over .
happy birthday , peter , and many happy returns of the day . here is a present for you .
i will look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon .
my present address is no . 415 green street . this is also my permanent address .
are there many side effects ?
i did clerical stuff and ran errands .
i am single , i have no real of , only an e-gf , that is you .
yes , quite sure .
sorry . it is the smallest size we have .
thank you , you are very kind !
perhaps your employer could supply us with one .
he never see eye to eye with me .
it is very helpful . the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures .
well , we will not be able to guarantee you a room for february 22 , but we can book you on february 23 . is that ok ?
how do you feel about overtime work ?
i hope it will last fine sorrow . i am going to have a picnic with my family .

how do you know about this company ?
not where , what . dutch means you both pay your own way .
your check will arrive a little late .
but it is absolutely our own business to have a child or not .
no , it is all included . besides , students do not have to pay council tax , so we are saving quite bit of money by living here .
welcome , mr . foster , if you would have a seat in the lounge area , our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment .
no problem . i am an ' olympic expert ' .
i think he is the boy who just moved into my apartment building .

oh , so bad . i am afraid i will change the image of myself .
what is it ?
tampering with cartons is easily detected . i should say that this rather discourages pilferage .

why not buy the sweater ? it only costs 30 yuan .
thank you . i am very excited .
can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?
thanks very much .
you have got to be careful on the food you eat .
providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i thought i could just get you and dad to pay for an apartment . i found a cheap one .
no , not very much . he is too ambitious and dishonest .
yeah , it has no value at all . who will use this cup today ?
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
did you forget to put anything on the list ?
i bought it when i was on vacation in nepal .
yes , we are a small family business .
it is so hot at lunchtime i would rather run in the morning .

the bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . it is priceless !

i would like to have some more . it is really good .
how do you know ?
whatever ! i am glad to learn something of chinese kung fu . thanks for asking me .
have you got the time , tom ?
what is wrong ?
what are your plans ?
what shall i do then ?
our house special is our cuervo gold margarita .
so would you say if things do not go your way at work it could easily get you down ?
oh , really ? and you are from the state , right ?
yes , i know . the boarding time on the ticket says 17
what classes did you have ?
and would you like to order now ?
runny nose and coughing .
yes , sir . that is more than enough time . i do appreciate your understanding . why do not we say 10: 00 of the clock on the 27th ?
recliner ? in my beautifully decorated living room ? i do not think so !
well , as we say , the rest is history ...
you get really passionate about this , do not you ? alright . i will watch it with you .
that is an excellent idea . hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! a few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .
you are from tangshan ? i cannot believe my ears . i was also born in tangshan , but i was brought up in beijing .
the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
the counselors were so nice too . it was the best summer ever . except for all those mosquitoes !
what is happened ?
about 2 of the clock in the morning .
sure , more elegant and taller .
but it is just a bar . there is no danger . you should not be so homophobic .
not today , thanks . but i would like to know any of the vegetarian dishes .
ok , that is absolutely fine . i will need to see some credentials before we can get started . do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ?
the iranians will give us a 10 discount if such a high order is placed with them . no doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller is business .
right . the people in your math class might not be the people you have science with .
oh , i see .
just a minute please .
let me know if i can do anything for you .
sure , liv , what can i do for you ?
is this the right bus , or not ?
it looks like you have to buy tickets for us , jason . and we are not going to see an action movie !
actually , a friend of a friend .
everything that you need for a successful job search is here . happy job searching !
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river .
do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ?
ok . oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you do not mind my asking ?
how about taking a cantaloupe ? it is light and sweet . children love it .
i ... er ... i just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks .
yes , but he is got a wife and 3 children as well .
you mean it is not created by the burglar ?
yes , mum .
but i do not think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? aha , someone has a crush on anny , does not he ?
great . i look forward to meeting you .
sure , no problem . i will ring to have a city tour . on sunday morning we can go to the great wall , then we can go to the summer palace in the afternoon . in the evening we can have typical dinner in restaurant in beijing . quanjude , a restaurant serving roast ducks . however if you do not like above trips , we can go some famous places outside of beijing .
so then , why do not you just go ?
you look wonderful .
thank you . where is your key ?
i was wondering when trash collection day was .
it is expensive , too . let is just sit in the sun and go swimming instead .
i am just poring over some brochures about various car models .
you gotta help me out this time , buddy .
about seven years now . and you ?
why not ? if i were you , i certainly would .
could you tell me when it will be back on ?
of course , i designed a more powerful gasoline engine , which greatly increased the speed of limousines .
if you do not like that , then you are probably going to be mad at what i tell you next .
thank you . i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
let me have a look . oh , no . they are chinese poems which describe this happy scene .
no , i just read the names off the packages ... ha !
it is a small room , just for 4 people .
i could not agree with you more . but i feel worried about what to do next as soon as i begin to write my resume .
i do not think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time .
what happens if i do not meet that requirement ?
i have it right here .
do you get paid onetime ?
where have you been ?
this is john laing from dantons .
of course . how are you ?
yes . here it is .
about three days .
let is see ... that was about six years ago .
ok , well , we are going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here is the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
ok , i promise . you promise you will be well soon ?
not really . but it has puzzled me for a long time .
really ? i was quite good at the hurdles and the discus .
yes , and hurry up !
yes , could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order ?
yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar .
why did not i think of that ?
that is the funny thing . i do not what is wrong with me . i just feel exhausted .
come on , you sound like my mom . look at that , it is beautiful !
very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house is richness .
great . will that be cash or charge ?
that is nice .
sorry about that . i was cleaning up .
going for a walk in such a cold weather ?
hello , may i make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ?
the place is ok . let is go there and have a look at it again .
will that be all then ?
right . thanks .
you are welcome . if you ask the conductor when he comes by , he should help you find one .
no , i am not . would you please drive slowly and carefully ?
how has may been ?
that is a lot of friends . do you have a best friend ?
no , a cv is not enough . you should also attach it with a cover letter . do not overlook it . you are faced with fierce competition in the job market . if your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of
good idea . remember to eat healthily too . the trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet .
yes , sir . i think you will find our gym quite satisfactory .
good morning . i have a bill of exchange against bank acceptance here . i would like to discount it . is that possible here ?
i think the best way i can do is to reduce our price by 2 and i should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 .
do you know that i fell in love with you at the first sight .
oh , is that what this is ?
do you have a better plan ?
well , i am not going to answer it . i am sleeping .
i am not sure .
we design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . we specialise in medium-sized generators but we are hoping to diversify into larger models next year .
i would have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three .
no , sir . the plant expansion project has been delayed . there was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits . it seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species .
what a cool see-through blue ! how do you wear this thing ?
yes . and you also overworked in last month , when steven asked for leave . i have been very satisfied with your performance . and your dependability has been a great asset .
we can figure that out right now . how much do you earn annually ?
ok . i will bring it with me .
how about a love story then ?
let is write it at once .
it is always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
hello , may i have a double cheeseburger ?
do you prefer some specific style ?
it was supposed to be for $ 100 .
what airline and what flight ?
do you have any questions ?
i will miss you too , my friends .
what else did she tell you ? did she tell you how many miles there are on it ?
and ? what does it say ? is not there a name ?
do you take credit cards ?
happy birthday , george . many happy returns of the day . here is a present for you .
whatever . give me another pack .
of course . this is my card . see you then .
good question . but i will tell you when you pass the first two .
yes . i would like to travel to london . so i want you to make a reservation for me on may 1st .
i am afraid he is not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he is not back yet .
and what color would you like ?
if that is the case . there is not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah ... you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week .
i have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . her name is lilling . she told me a lot about your company and i became quite interested . i believe i can have a promising career with the development of this company .
yes , i would like some information about the trains to beijing .
stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
huh ? did not you know ? are not you excited ?
those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
i am sure you will love it .
it is no use complaining . if we had got enough money , we would not put up with it !
how many hours do you work each day now ?
yes . mike lee . and put me as close as possible to the stage , please .
thanks . i finally got rid of that old nissan that got me through college .
what the hell . that does not make sense . what are you going to do ?
it should be due in at 7: 30 a.m . tomorrow .
cannot hurt to try . carpe diem . who can say if we will be here tomorrow or not ?
that seems reasonable . we should get together and watch the ball drop in times square .
that is all . thank you for your co-operation .
the point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .
now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures .
no . nothing . i am sorry .
after the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on .
right now i will teach you to open files , save files and copy files . are you ready ?
me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
what is wrong with it ?
because i come hiking every week . that is why i am in good-shape . i think that i should bring you a walkingstick next time .
well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . that is why many people think such rules acceptable . after all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money .
i pulled you over because your brake light is out .
yes , i think i am quite fluent in english . i got the certificate of the secondary english training last month .
it gives you money ?
yes , i want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company is image to appeal to different customer bases . i want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we have been talking about today ...
so you are .
you can get a liang if you want . a liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . that would be 330nt .
it is selling like hot cakes , and we have lots of regulars now . would you like to place a trial order ?
i do not know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i do not know if you are aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there is just too much instability . i would not feel comfortable investing in this climate .
what is next ?
yes . your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be

actually , i do not think you can call the police . not yet at least . he has not done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it . but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .

i believe they add locally produced honey to it .
yeah . even though the customs were brilliant , i did not think it was as good as the first two . what did you think ?

it runs fine .
i am having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .

my family and i are going to dinner .
you sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes .
what were you writing ?
it is okay .
sir , wait ! ! i need your address !
that is just it , i am not happy anymore , tim . it is not you , it is me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
actually , many taiwanese wake up late on sunday mornings , too . it may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
all right , it is a date .
i had a sneaking suspicion about you , eric , i think you have lost it .
is that right ?
we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water .
by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday .
what did i do wrong ? did i take a wrong turn ?
sweet . can you tell me where it is ?

maybe i could buy some cognac for my brother . he always drinks it .
absolutely . several men have tried it in my a shop . do you want to try ?
eating here or to go ?
are you certain that that is what you want to do ?
yes . we have herb medicine and ready-made medicine .
thank you . please bring us a bottle of dry white wine .
master card . here you go .
but the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president .
actually , i have not had a pizza for a while . let is do that then .
and what does your husband do ?
if you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free .
hello , i ordered a dining table last week . the order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . i would like to exchange it .
yes ! thank goodness you are here . these bugs are driving us crazy !
i do not know what to say . i would like to replace it .
certainly . what time would you like us to call you ?
single , please . how much in total ?
um , that is good .
let is have a try .
not at all .
i have got to catch the last bus . see you later .
do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ?
i am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . but before that , i must do my job . bye . do not forget about that note .
cannot bear it , right ? i have been there before . i will feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing .
if i were him , i would give him a good talking-to . i would insist on his stopping fooling around like that .
oh , yes , i know the one . how was the food ?
i see . not everyone is cut out to work in management .
it was ok . there was a lot of turbulence , though .
nearly ten years .
it is a light blue coat . it is got a hood and a big silver zipper .
i like slim girls , so i doubt i would find a plump girl attractive . you will have to give me some more information .
certainly , madam . what kind of coffee do you want to have ?
what do you think of the ending ?
ok , i have finished cleaning the blackboard .
that is not nice .
this one is much better . can i try on the ring with this necklace ?
good evening . we want a dinning room with a table for eight .
yes , he had just bought a new motorcycle .
that is still too much . can you lower the price further ?
i am fabulous .

you are our honored guests .
of course . because the tv stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
yes . i would like make a reservation to huston for tomorrow .
i always catch this bus .
ha-ha . birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family .
i will not miss the boat when there is another opportunity again next time .
good question . i have to think about it .
let is sit over there .
you are welcome . by the way , is there a pay phone near here ?
well . what time would you like me to pick you up ?
thank you . i did not want to have to take this to court .
ok , sir . is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
thanks anyway , but i will do it , rebecca . let is get to class .
what can i help you with ?
again ? the area around the park is too dark at night . there should be more lights there .
of course , she should take minutes .
there is not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ?
i like it well-done , please .
it will take half an hour to get to the hotel .
well then , what are your spoils ?
right this way , mr . mason . we can start with our front office . when ms . terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . there is a conference room already prepared
what about you , mary ?
he does not lift a finger ! i bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .

i am so sorry , i have been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . i would have arrived but for that .
i will pay it as soon as possible .
could you give me some advice on books for killing time on the train ?
yes . i can see . the summer heat is over . and the winter cold is still far away .
let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in april !
that is true . well , it is obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . so , do you spend all your money on it ?
i do not believe it .
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
hello , ms li , this is mr peng .
oh , oh , madam , madam , i am afraid you have the wrong number .
and this is your company is head office ?
your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it did not look like real rice to me .
if you are hungry , then cook something .
i remember you are in love .
yes , i need this prescription please .
my last appointment is at 3 , so i should be free by 5 at the very latest . i think i could get to the airport by 6 .
i am going to the bank . i need to cash some checks .
yes , and it is 37 c .
no , i am strictly a spectator . i just like watching skating . it is so beautiful .
ok . here is the money . and if i return the card , can i get the refund ?
they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
i thought it was o . k. but it really was too hot . and i think they should show people more . the exhibits should be more interesting .
i thought this bus went down park avenue .
oh , i do not know where we are going yet .
so which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
looks like you are not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
i guess that is because so many people drop out of that class .
is there anything i can do for you ?
ah , great ! i will send someone over to pick it up . thanks for calling .
you are leaving on tuesday morning .
we can just each get what we want to get .
this one will suit me best . what do you think ?
i went sky-diving !
i am very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
three . would you please help us take them to the hall ?
let me see ... i am sorry the tables you want are booked .
it cannot have been that bad . go on and tell me about it .
sure . i think filet steak will be a good choice . it is the best local food .
ok , let me think . the roller coaster looks more fun .
for the job .
it is forty-five dollars a night for two . is anyone else traveling with you ?
there is nothing else to it .
oh yeah , i saw the tea house the other day . i think i might go and have a look sometime . it is a nice neighborhood here .
yes , let is total it .
what about next saturday .
i am very sorry , miss parks , but the 9: 05 flight is completely booked . i can put you on a waiting list if you would like .
oh , yes . that is just the one i want . i will take it .
how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ?
you could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions .
thanks to your help . to our friendship .
goodbye . thanks again .
i am afraid that i forgot to send it in .
you are right . but you know it is so hard to give up the old habit like smoking .
geez . is that all ?
look at your right-hand . is it the zone of the lost maya kingdom ?
why do you say that ?
he nursed a viper in his bosom . his best friend tony foamed him in . tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him .
but you just got here . cannot you stay a little longer and have some tea ?
how would you miss it ?
yes , i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
i need to hire you .
my major is automobile designing and i have received my master is degree in science . i think i can do it well .
yes , i would .
that is true . i guess we will have to keep looking for a manager then .
i have a great idea of where you might like to go .
okay . stay home sunday . but friday we should go out dancing .
please give me two fried eggs , two orders of toast and a cup of coffee .
ok , could you give me your details and i will see if it has cleared . we need your banking details and some id . a passport or something like that ?
no , i cannot agree with you . she is one but not the other .
i want to have a different color carpet .
do not mention it .
that would be great . what is the blood test for ?
yes . actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in atm machines , so that you will not have to come in to the bank to make a transaction .
i am thinking about buying this sweater . i know it is june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
maybe we should just wait for the next bus .
that is terrible . but if they would not change them , i know what i would do .
ok . what time ?
as far as i know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . are you stressed at all ?
why do you say so ?
i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
what is the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
what do you need my id for ?
wonderful ! a modest , comfortable room . ah , a beautiful window , through which i can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . how nice !
i will give it back to you in a couple of days .
we gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . we come together and call it church .
it is not your fault . no one will blame you .
i also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather .
i am afraid it is . so you will have to pay two yuan extra . the total charge is four yuan .
well , in that case , you have to pay for it . please fill out the form first .
yes we checked on just now .
i do not like peppermint ice cream .
it is , is not it ?
he would get very angry if anyone criticized him .
what if we are out sick ?
which place are you most interested in ?
i guess so . would you mind if i checked my email quickly ? i am supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client .
you are welcome .
you are welcome .
how much money would you like to withdraw ?
you have a girlfriend in thailand ? interesting . how come i have never heard of that ?

just a moment . i am sorry . at the moment , he is out of the office . would you like to leave your number ? when he comes back , i will tell him to call you back .
i am not making anything .
maybe , but i think people usually learn english more quickly than chinese .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning , i got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .
so you knew it was me ?
do i need to take a bus ?
that is a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
they are soft .
no , it is not . it is 1199866 . it seems that you have misdialed .
that is a hefty amount . but that should have no problem at all . you should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though .
did you take any cold medication ?
she tried , but the line is always busy .
is that different from our school is english course ?
now i can tell you are definitely addicted to the overflow of information .
all of it is important please just do your best at all times .
yes . my customer is in urgent need of the steel plates .
oh , no . when we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . it was a hard time .
do you have any other special skills ?
can i be of any help to you ?
i have chosen january as the month for this retreat .
i have no plans for friday , so curry would be great . which restaurant do you have in mind ?
do you need anything else from me ?
i am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid .
good news ! i will be glad to . when do you need it ?
i like one taken half length .
why is that ?
that does not matter . i want at least 4 percent .
no , not really .
your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would give us a discount . you know for the products like yours we usually get 2 or 3 discount from european suppliers .
beneficial ? i do not think so . if two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . if they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . by any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
that is splendid . can you take three pictures of me with them ?
thanks . now i would like to check out this book .
thanks very much .
my mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but i clean my room .
what do you want to get ?

so , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ?
he certainly is . he is the peckham in our collage .
what would you like to go with your steak ?
wait a minute , my uncle lives in beijing and he lives very close to theatre . i have telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . we would better have breakfast now . and meet him later .
i know what you mean . i am not only after bucks . there is something more in life .
is it urgent ? our ambulances are not enough to meet every call .
i need change for the machines ?
yes , after you have been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
how am i supposed to log on to the computer ?
it is my pleasure , sir . i wish you a pleasant stay here . goodbye !
how about this one ? this is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one .
i have been accepted !
i agree , toni . i think the biggest problem we are facing is how to bring it in under budget .
yes , bill smith in room 713 .
i am not certain . do you know ?
sorry , we do not . but i think you can fly on northwest airlines to berlin and then have a connecting flight on canada airline to toronto . and it is the most economical flight , just 1,900 dollars .
why are you considering trying for it ?
there are different things you can do . for one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking . you should go to the course . also , i am pretty good at taking notes . i can help you on this exam . i will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes . then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down .
it is 687 3452 .
it is interesting . i think i will take the bus tour . by the way , what about the lodging ?
i see , bring me the whole wheat toast .
just tell me what you would like , please .
well , i am not too happy about it .
what is the exchange rate today ?
no , it is not . it is a pity , because i would like to see it in action .
it is my pleasure .
you cannot just throw me out on the street !
do you think that you want to try this restaurant another time ?
the redskin is quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we are losing again .
i think i would like to do that . i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies .
i do not know . you know what they say about office romances .
has he moved to his new house yet ?
what is the house rent ? when is the rent due ? and how much security deposit do you require ?
that works for me . let is see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on friday .
sure . what do you want ?
the worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . it also leads to more unemployment in the long run . i do not know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ...
how long would you like to keep it ?
well , i go to the gym a lot . i am a member of a gym nearby .
because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year old tree .
the service was not that great , either .
most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens .
i will have a double whiskey on the rocks .
i am a tourist in this city and unfortunately i have lost my card !
that is good . i will take it .
sure . no problem .
oh , really ?
but i am not sure you are strong enough yet . here is some seafood rice soup i made . it is delicious .
can i take it with food ?
what a surprise ! this is the best present i have ever received .
that will be fine .
yes , my first marriage was a failure .
leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . just close the cubby door and walk away .
i cannot afford it .

we are all the same the first time we travel overseas . you guys have a nice trip .
it is absolutely delicious ! that is the best tiramisu i have ever had !
great . i will see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
it is kind of strange though , to have snow in april , and so much of it .
just the video .
can you give me a wholesale list ?
this one is 1500 yuan .
his new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air .
not at all , it is reasonable .
i hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time .
i have been at my current job for 10 years .
good , if you agree we will draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
i could not even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then would have to find my own place .
if you are a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations .
everything goes well , but i am thinking about quitting my current job .
you see ? you are becoming more decisive already !
what do you suggest ? i cannot afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
cream soup and steak , please .
oh ! you mean she does not have to work now ? it is hard for young parents not to overreact , is not it ?
i will try to speak more clearly .
yes . are you ?
great ! good luck .
we do indeed . such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested .

it does ' t matter . i know that people are easy to get mad when they are tired .
i really like your books . i have just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
would you like a balance inquiry first , mr mayhew ?
how long have you been learning it ?
they are much better
no , not at all . go ahead .
okay . thanks .
yes . the forbidden city is divided into two parts . the southern section , or the outer court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the inner court was for his royal family .
alright , alright . how did you cut this so bad ?
that is our office block . we have all the administrative depart - ments there . down there is the research and development section .
actually , the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
that may be , but you are still under arrest . and you would better stop talking .
well , we will give you our decision in a couple of days . it is a pleasure to talk to you , mr . liu .
alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?

it says that there will be a blackout from 5 p.m . to 7 p.m . in our neighborhood today .

i am here to ask about a loan .
well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .

never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed .
mrs . smith has not checked in yet .
yeah , i think so . it is very simple .

and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
we are thinking of a two days ' tour to vienna .

it is a chilly day folks , so do not forget your coats ! what about tomorrow kenny ? do you have good news for us ?

i am calling to notify you that an export l c has arrived for you .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?

well . in that case , you must have got good records in english , too .
at first , i thought it was me .
how time flies ! i will not see twenty again .
i have received a full scholarship , so i will not need any other money to live off while i am studying .

i , i do not feel like saying it
i only want it for the kitchen . i like to listen to the news at breakfast time .
the collar ? it is just the collar that is popular with young people in shanghai .

hop in , i will give you a ride .
after a while ... i am his guide . what is the trouble with him , doctor
is it chicken ?
i see . can i pay by credit card ?
i am not sure whether i can pass the course or not .
she is my roommate , not my date . the d-man , as in dork .
i do not really have time to learn anything new . i need to spend my time studying !
i would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar .
where do you see yourself five years from now ?
no . you go ahead and putt it out . then i'il go .
how about a blouse ? this one here is the latest fashion .
that is what i did .

no , but i will be able to tomorrow .
i have never had one person that i would idolized . the comparisons to jul-ia roberts are incredibly flattering . i do not really know who i would compare myself to . i would like to be a combination of a lot of people . a little bit of everything , really . i have not quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and i have definitely found my weaknesses .
first and secondary research . i hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing .
even he is not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends .
most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
ah , yes , that is right .
yes . i did some work on that , and i found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . i was sure i had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . i think the most important thing , i learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records .
good . go on , please .
actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
can you tell her i am waiting to speak to her ?
he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it is all good .

ok . after three days , i will come to you for it .
i will call the taxi immediately , sir .
good morning , doctor . i feel terrible . i have god a cold and i have a rash here on my neck . i am not sleeping well either . what do you think the problem could be ?
then how about the others ?
good idea ! i have always been interested in that . how much is the entrance fee ?
he has a bad cold .
i usually do housework in mornings . i go shopping occasionally . i like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . i always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . it takes about
oh , i know a place where you might like to eat .
you cancelled the song , did not you , jack ?
we are going to need a loan . i am not sure what loan is suitable for us , though .
i am sorry , sir , you cannot bring fresh fruit into china . i am going to have to confiscate these .
here is your ballot card .
i think so .
you look great , you are absolutely glowing .
the supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole .

just two weeks .
ok , just follow me .
how long does it take to earn a bachelor is degree ?
make it french please .
really ? how often do you go there ?
of course . that is what we deserve .
have you tried an outlet ?

yes , that is right .
do you have a plan to make up your missed work ?
no , sorry . i do not know .
she is another antique .
ah , hello quinn . oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , are not you ?
i am afraid there must be a lot of people there .
thank you . where is the washing room ?
yeah , i saw someone walking like you , but i was not sure . we have not seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
wait , what are you doing ! you cannot just kiss me then go for second base !
that is great . when are you starting ?
moreover , it is easy to clean , right ? you are really lazy .
yes , it is . we have been dating for over 7 years . we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
there you go .
just a second . i will go get some . then you need to send the file . make sure you choose the right printer . we have a few here and you are hooked up to all of them .
like the job you feel the most proud of .
oh , come on . let is not beat a dead horse .
yes , i have been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he is my idol .
really ? you only review your lessons in one month ? does it work ?
well , let is get a plate of those then .
she seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem , i would prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves .
yes . farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . we counted over twenty squirrels .
oh , what does he look like ? is he tall ?
i will write a letter soon . i hope you are all well .
well , the free stuff ! you know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc .
i know a few extensions but i do not know them all .
i never had a home inspection before .
you will feel comfortable paying the money .
at our club .
i washed my car instead .
i understand . when do you think i can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ?
i got the movie when it came out on dvd , do you want to come over ?
no . not right now . when i feel better i will call you again .
i am very sorry i cannot .
really good ! you should try it sometime .
you are welcome , have a safe trip .
we definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
how long does it take to get there ?
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
you are welcome .
yes , this one is in service . put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . then you will see some instructions on the screen .
is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
well , it is a wedding gift .
are you a football player ?
no problem . i will give you an aisle seat in the center row . and here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . please board the plane at gate 15 .
sure , for at least three thousand per month .
i do not agree with you . i maintain that we are healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago .
i know . i really want to go to the beach .
sure . come on in .
well , i will think about it . i do not know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase .
do not worry about that . i have already calculated the money about things you will buy . remember to give me the receipt when you come back .
actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays .
that is why we want to have a look at other hotels . we do not want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
no , not much .
actually it will be my first time to meet her .
what would you do ?
it is a difficult choice . the train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
ok . i am pretty happy and i can go abroad .
i am talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
i am free at 1
i am glad to hear that you finally found an apartment .
it does not matter . it happens to everyone .
yes . that is why i like the house .
sure , honey , we are talking now , are not we ?
oh , sure . i will be back in a minute . thank you for waiting . here it is . did you enjoy your meal ?
it seems perfect .
but , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff .
but i prefer burnt bread .
but i cannot sing it well .
my name is max richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? i have a rather timely matter to discuss with him .
i just keep getting a busy signal .
goodbye , and try not to miss any more school .
i think your background and experience are worth the compensation .
i am serious .
it is a beautiful morning is not it ?
i am interested in one-bedroom . do you have any available ?
very well . just take your time .
including my keys ?
but what would other people think ?
everything is fine with me .
that is amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .
let me confirm your order , mr . white in room 204 , chinese food . is that right ?
i do not know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me .
well , what is the weather report ?
i am so relieved . i just passed the bar exam .
do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ?
that is great . thank you so much .
yes . show me the sweaters , please .
daniel loves the beach very much !
good . let is iron out the remaining details . when do you want to take delivery ?
americans also do not go to work on saturdays .
i hope so .
tell me where you live .
i will take your advice .
really ? why not ? i hear it is pretty good .
i have been studying hard for my examinations . and you ?
you know you would spend it . and also , money in the bank earns interest .
we have that package .
... i am seeing someone . this is yi-jun , my ...
my children would like that they like dancing very much .
i have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by . what time would you like to provide the refreshment ?
sure , here is my business card . i am james wilson . let me explain to you how things are . in recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . the price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent .
i already have something to wear .
a bit over two years . this is a fast-moving company , and seniority is not the only factor in deciding promotions .
yeah , that will be fine .
did we get off the bus too early ?
we have received many bookings . but we will try our best .
how did you get on with your studies in university ?
yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . the student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she must read it in the library during that time . that way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it .
you too . i hope to see you soon . goodbye .
she is not too tall .
ah , it is hard to say .
masha and hero are getting divorced .
they look all right to me .
excellent ! now what are the hours ?
if i had enough money , i would buy one , but i do not even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods .
ok . thank you . bye-bye .
oh , gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i cannot bear it anymore !
i will go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe .
sounds not bad ! you know , the only thing i worried about is the safety . i am not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
you need a bath every day .
that would take care of it , thank you .
go to www . yahoo . com and click on travel and tickets . there are about a billion sites to look at .
i am going to register at harvard next month .
it is a piano recital . i am fond of piano , you know .
but you cannot use so much . the machine will not be able to rinse the soap out .
oh , not too bad . i am just glad the weekend is finally here .
thank you , but no . this will do it for now .
i promise i will .
this is amazing . i am glad we decided to take this bus tour . so where next ?
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
if you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one .
alright . well , i will stay here and have another coffee . nice running into you .
about 2 weeks .
there are many factors that weigh in , but nasdaq is down 200 points , the dow jones indicator also suffered ! our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago .
yes . today is tuesday , so the boss went off to his mba seminar class . he is out of the office every tuesday and thursday mornings , and he has classes all day saturday and sunday .
sure , i advise the sightseeing buses .
will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ?
yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job .
what took so long ? i thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !
okay . the library is beside the baker is . i would better take back the videos we borrowed last week . they are overdue .
good . i will send your catalogues to those who are interested . meanwhile , may i have an indication of price ? can i have your price-sheet ?
it is under the couch .
yes . cortex just stole darren mcdowell from rolly . and probably darren will be here . so he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old cortex coworkers .
certainly , i can can help you with that . what type of account would you like to open ? a chequing or a savings account ?
so why do you think you are in love ?
that is right .
the fans are great here , too . not like in philadelphia .
it is hard to believe this little thing is so valuable to us .
that is a good idea . i think we will soon come to a solution to the problem .
i would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference .
i like them very much . we also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .
thanks for the warning .
you are welcome .
i am pretty satisfied with it . i can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities .
i am really busy right now . i got a lot on my plate . so this is not an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ?
i am not looking for excuses here . i just want to get this finished on time !
here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
how are you going to do that ?
yet in writing , george has nothing on frank .
this is mr . stewart . who is this ?
that is good service . do we have to pay extra for that ?
a week ago ? they met last summer and now just sink . they will be married soon .
take me to hilton hotel .
where did you go there .
how much do you want to draw ?
i will call them this afternoon , thanks .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
i think so . yes , they get along so well .
my poor memory . thank you very much .
we need an operator now .
yes , of course . would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ?
that is nice and easy . thanks for your time .
it is a special green tea named longing tea from zhejiang province .
yes , you are right . i like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ?
i am sure they will not , but that is my view on gay marriage .
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
what do you do ?
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
why do not we spend this vacation earning our tuition ?
so you must be an extravert ?
where are you going to get your chinese food from ?
bbs means bulletin board service .
i know , i know . but i do not want any worms .
do you have any advice ?
they are not actually that bad . they could be worse . what do you think about it ?
what ? really ? i do not really want to have to buy a new phone .
how about the microphone and speakers ?
just two blocks away , in that tall building .
have i really got to do those exams again , dad ?
my name is david . nice to meet you , too .
i am . what can i do for you ?
yeah , there are so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
well . we plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com . cn and shanghai morning newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule .
surely of course .
thank you . anything else ?
what about the yellowstone national park ?
no . i am tired and i have got to work tomorrow .
just one piece .
wait a moment , let me check it out for you . it is 200085 .
i see . i generally like movies to help calm me down . i think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it .
first of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you do not do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
and thanks to you .
what should i do after that ?
here is your change . thank you for shopping with us .
all right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one year lease ?
certainly , i will make an appointment for you with mr . jordan of the egypt national native produce and animal by-products import and export corporation .
to tell you the truth , i am really nervous . i had a dream last night that i was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . i just hope ms . mendoza will not be able to hear my teeth chattering . i just hope i get through this in one piece .
you are here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here is your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
it was fantastic , but i am glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
and it is been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . just amazing !
oh , jack , you deserve it . you have been working so hard .
that is wonderful ! you must be really proud of him !
what about a gila monster ?
he is predicting clear skies .
oh , yes ?
maybe you are right . but the major is not fit for me . i like architecture more than computers .
and when is the closing date ?
yes , you are lucky . but you should go to the ultrasonic department to disperse the stone . meanwhile , i will give you some herbal medicine .
yes , that is our personal wealth management service .
can you reduce more ?
i am sorry . that must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family .
yes , i have . but i have to wait .
so how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
i want 100 pounds . and here are 189 u . s . dollars .
yes , i want to deposit 1000 yuan in my bank account .
yeah , i guess so .
how about this product selling from last month on ?
they should fill in an application form , hand in the copies of identification card and household register .
never mind . what about taking a look around the theater ?
yeah , i think so . i think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . it is as plain as the hump on a camel . you cannot miss it .
yes , you can have a money link card . you can also base the account on time deposits . the choice is yours .
they are saying it was already there .
ok , so i first thanks them for their business , i can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , how is that ?
all right . wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
as far as i know , people will be weak if they swim too long .
i am sorry . i guess i am too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank .
that is what made it so great .
actually , i need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen .
yes , there is . those organizations exist . you always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .
why did not you tell me about that before ?
well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the paralympics .
that is a good idea . and in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things .
then what makes a iset ' of clubs ?
is there anything i can do to help you ?
tell me the news .
it is $ 120 per yard including a 5 discount .
well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
my pleasure ! how much would you like to spend on your date ?
do you guarantee its quality ?
sure , this way please .
i think that unfortunately it is more important than a person is character . advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . i think it is wrong , but that is the way the world is now .
ok . what can i do if l want to cancel the ticket ?
the instructions for the copier are posted on it .
well , the bartender would not give me the pitcher of beer . anyway . he said it was too close to closing time .
yes , on a business trip . how about yuu ?
and he is always busy with his pictures and roses .
that is no problem . i know that every company has busy periods . when this happens , i am ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .
how about this one ?
no , not on the train , but in the station .
i am sorry . i think we are out of this skirt in this color . do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it is available there ?
where is the fitting room ?
yes . i would like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily .
a :: tim , please . please be seated .
we have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
what can we do ?
no , it is free .
here you go . look in this flyer , or check with the produce person .
your achievement is obvious to all .
about 20 of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges .
as the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . all work and no play makes jack a dull boy , you know ?
well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i was not permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing .
oh . i enjoy watching boxing on television , too . what a pity i missed it last night !
could you tell me now some of the things i need to do ?
yes , miss .
i thought that we could leave around 8
thanks . i appreciate it .
ok , i see .
according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .
well , check the newspaper .
no one has ever checked me for allergies .
i do not know any of the laws they are trying to pass .
i mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ?
that is okay . if it were not for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing !
well-done , please .
actually , i do not think i can eat another bite !
do not worry . my friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule .
i am not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it is probably better if you do not call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
she is a clever mother .
i will , michelle . speak to you soon .
that is a lovely hat .
some of the scenes moved me into tears .
i do . i am a big fan of using new technology , but i do not want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
how about some beatles ?
above all , i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .
why do you say such words ? i love you very much .
thank you , they are beautiful .
i would like to file a complaint .
you are right . mother is love is the greatest love in the world .
that is really a good phenomenon to see .
do not you think you would miss having other people around ?
eleven of the clock on friday morning . see you then .
oh , it costs too much . it is more expensive than the public school .
that suits me fine .
is this to stay or to go ?
i know . i know . i do not smoke too much , though .
you are lucky .
yeah , that is a good idea , and you like to cook .
that is true . but our staff meetings are very important , arnold . i do not know how we can function without them .
i would like you to manage a new online auction site we are building .
i am sorry for running it , but i really did not know .
sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer .
when you put it that way , i guess the skies cannot hold out on us forever .
whatever ! alright , i will concede the silly gramophone , if you will agree that i get the silver tea set .
is a white blouse okay ?
yes . i am going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
that is a good idea . when you do not know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone .
i know , dear . i am too . but we have just been too busy to look for a house .
okay . follow me please .
i am thinking something exciting but safer .
not a problem . we offer a personal loan for studying abroad for anyone who is studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . anyone is eligible to apply
the tip is rather narrow .
it is a rash . i would better take you to see the doctor . how did you get that bruise on your leg ?
roger vargas is up at bat . the pitcher winds up and strike one !
who invented the electric light bulb ?
how long did the meeting last ?
oh , it is out of paper . do you have any more ?
i can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net .
will you apologize to her ?
hey , sis . you know me , if i do not like everything on the menu , i do not go back to the restaurant !
then take the next left then the next right . are you with me ?
umm ... that is the spirit !
to the ministry government hall .
well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . now tell me about the best job you have ever had , please .
i hate working out .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
thank you ! i am interested in your product . but i am not familiar with your corporation .
there is a supermarket in kensington high street . i will come and give you a hand .
take the books out of the bookcase . put them in this box .
well , now that i know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime .
oh , i am not sure i agree with you . it was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . actually , it was not too bad .
ok , fine . we need to take down the tree .
oh ! it was for a market sale manager . is that still available ?
i am sorry , but we usually do not do it . it is our policy .
i know . it really makes a mess of the whole election process .
have you just been to the cinema ?
count me in !
i am still young . and i am growing every minute .
well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we will try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery .
that sounds great . i will bring a bottle of wine then .
goodbye and see you tonight . miss rose .
i shopped there before too , but the food is better at whole foods .
it is , but i can put you on a waiting list , if you would like .
what do you think of the teacher ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok , i will take it .
where did you go to university ?
i do not think it is very nice . and my father does not like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here .
how can i ever thank you ? i owe you a big favor .
i do not try to go ahead of people and lead them , i would rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together .
i love science fiction and fantasy , but i have been reading a lot of both lately , so i would prefer to get something else .
what is on ?
of course . we would be happy to cash it for you .
what about the environmental factors ?
i wanted to , but the water is too cold , and i just wetted in up to my knees .
i never know when to shake hands and when not to . can you tell me something about it ?
you always work too hard , jim . as the saying goes , all work and no play makes jack a dull boy . you should spare some time for a rest .
i have a flat tyre .
no , thanks .
operations is made up of manufacturing , materials , shipping and distribution etc .
no . it is only about five minutes ' walk .
wonderful . how much is the cost altogether ?
ur , it stinks !
what do you mean ?
yes , a passport will be fine .
but i do not like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do .
very funny . what is wrong with you today ? you are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . do you know that ?
ok , i will try and put you through . please hold .
now that is an exciting job ! ! !
what made you decide to volunteer ?
ok . thanks for your support .
oh , yes ! this is much better . but it has an aluminum handle .
yeah , me too .
i am very sorry . sir . i will ask the manager to take care of this .
i have four years study in the department of mechanical engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . moreover , i have worked at cab company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience .
perfect . thanks very much for calling . see you soon , bye !
can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ?
you are welcome .
no . i am still working on it .
do you know what street it goes on ?
i am looking for someone who works here , but i lost his business card . his name is long or sang or something like that .
good . i think i will choose this single breasted one . when can i get it ?
yes , and i am a very good driver .
this is going to take more time than i thought .
thanks a lot . and i believe i will have a good time working with you .
yes , i think we might be free . what did you have in mind ?

relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . several european countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down .
mind your own business .
around six pm .
my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road .
i think you should give it a shot . what do you have to lose ? you can always change your mind .

i am chinese by birth .

your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees .
the federal food and drug administration , or the fda as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the united states . over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers .
well , they are very nice you know .
that is all right .
well , i do not ... anymore .
um , tracy ? i think that is a little too formal . i know you want to be polite but you have already made contact with them , so in english you can be more relaxed in the opening ...
sure , no problem . what are you trying to get ?

ok . the last piece is for your dessert . we are having dinner soon .
i would love to help you out , but i am a bit short on cash this month as well . i had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings .
and three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
i will buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . if they suit me , i will come back for the others later .
we are trying to raise money for the campaigns .

the brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .

okay , i will ask bob to cover it .
... i know i will be killed if i pee on the toilet seat .
it would be nice to get out of the city . do you want some company ?
there is some , but i do not think it is a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . there is very little major crime .

i do not know . i have no idea .

i read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! and i noticed that he will not ship abroad .
what is the service like ?
about a year ago actually . you have probably never seen her though .
there you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .
he must have just got online for the first time last week . he still thinks it is some kind of new toy .
actually , i do not like history . lately , these shows are always about the pyramids .
hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
such an eye ! the true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure ! there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . one hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . she is loveliness itself .
we are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . inside we will use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . you will see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse .

los angeles is in california . it is southeast of san francisco .
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
oh , i see .
nice to meet you , too . did you have any difficulty finding our company ?
what is the matter ?
so , what is the problem ?
when i was a young boy , i used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of hyderabad . it was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . one day , he was approached by members of the cia , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . i never saw him again . i vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the indian intelligence bureau .
i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex .
or because they are less attractive to to chinese men .
i think i might move in with my parents for a couple of months until i can find something . you know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . i am gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while .
you should wear a tie to go with your suit .
that is not a problem , miss . will that be it ?

yes , it is .
thank you so much .
ok . i know . thank you .
no , i just started working here at ibm , i am assigned sale department .
perhaps i would better ring the police ...
great ! would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?
the interesting thing is to see what really works and what is just hype .
it makes sense , right ? who else is going to eat it ?
it slipped my mind .
yes , an efficiency is a small apartment . usually one large room and a small bathroom . there is often a small kitchen too . so it is good for one person .
are not animals the main content of chinese paper-cuts ?
i will get him one of those little dogs .
i understand . but why will not you show me the logo ?
not as much as i would like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas .
the counter is at the end of the aisle . they are kept in the ice chest .

sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful .
thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak .
really ? have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
30 of the people are attracted by the style . buyers always pay great attention to packing . in my opinion , these goods did not sell well merely because of the poor packing .

ok . how much is the deposit ?
why do not you go to bed and get up early ? you will have the same time for work .
do you go to church regularly ?
it is a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . we could also add rollaways .

it only gets crowded once it gets to la .
all right , sis !
would i have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ?
she started feeling suspicious after you said that .
maybe i could have a try .

i will not , mum .
a new car . and i have got a small family , two children , and i have not got a lot of money and ...
tell him i was asking about him .
what does she like to do ?
it is not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
very good ! now , it is still morning here in new york .
i hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced . you should be fine .
you mean it is a still virtual game . your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ?

the london weekly right ?
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what is under the hood ?
does it include a facial mask and a massage ?
i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .
do you have id ?
for what purpose exactly , if you do not mind me asking ? i must ask because i need to know the size , you see .
this friday evening ?
the worker stadium .
first , let is read clause two about packing . it is our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that will save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we would like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .

and your parents took it badly ?
i would like to look at some watch .
why do you choose the law school ?
no . i will fly back twelve days from now .

you have got a fever and playing football is not a good idea for a boy with a fever . what is that on your arm ?
is it the rush hour now ?
yes , there is . see you then .

yeah , but i do not know if it is going to be any good .
certainly . may i ask who is calling , please ?

how would it go ? did we win ?
right , here it is .
i visited the first international flower festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers !
well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . but in your case , we will try to have it ready sooner . how about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?

at hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping is not customary .
it is true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money .
i took a lot of courses , such as philosophy , logic , ethics , aesthetics , etc .
of course i wrote down the work that i had done on the continued claim form .

i thought american express was accepted everywhere . never mind . here is my visa .

it looks like there are a lot of people inside .
here is the notice .
umm ... you know ... actually i was thinking of trying another airline . no need to hold my seat .

thank you very much .
i do not know , but i am sure the produce person can tell you .
that is ok , keep going , you are moving ahead by leaps and bounds . watch your dynamics ! keep your elbows lifted . remember to stroke the keys , do not pound . that is better ! remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship .
right . i will see if i can catch the waitress is eye .
great . shall i meet you there around 7: 45 tomorrow night ?
yes , sir .
is there a maximum number of copies i can make ?
me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
a 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . if you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money .
by airmail or seamail ?
how about this one ? it is the latest design .
sure . if we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . i can get all the carpet out this weekend .
whoa , when .
yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .
okay , i will sign you up .
we have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ...
i think i will sign a nine-month lease in case i decide not to go to summer school . i can extend it if i want to stay , cannot i ?

here we are .
you apparently missed a court appearance .
we still have most of the tickets we bought . we can go on a lot of different rides if you like .
when i booked the room , your staff did not mention this . and the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that .
i did not know you knew how to draw and paint .

i am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day .
right . red rochester will officiate at the wedding .
i mainly eat baked chicken , because there is not a lot of fat .
yes , most of them think it is good . but , some people have different opinions . they consider we should arrange some challenging activities .
hi mike , how are you doing ?
yes , i would like to check in .
i am going to stay at home .
yes . but we should hire someone for that . that will probably be expensive . and it has to be done right .
i will be there .
the sunshine state certainly is worth visiting . come down for a vacation sometime . i will take you to disney world .
oh , do not be so sad . you can ask for a salary raise .
in whose name was the reservation made ?
as soon as possible .
can i help you ?
but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
that is ok . there was not anything important in there anyway . the shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage .
this one is especially built for hard , continuous play . and every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make it a dependable one for tournament use .
that is a lot of money .
are dresses going to be on sale ?
he is always confused by easy questions .

of course . but i suggest you buy a lipgloss . the shining effect is in .
i am not sure i am following you , sir .
the final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . i think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .

the small ones are one hundred yuan for each . and the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ?
do not worry . there are all kinds of things in the center .
well . do not forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? now , let is start our lesson .
that is good . when can i go to see the house ?
i need to remit 500 to london .
three for ten cents .
i think i would better . i have twenty four credits this time around . that might be a bit much .
we have been through this a million times ! let is get going already ! i am ready !
that would be to go .
i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
it does not matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
your desire coincides with ours .
well , you guys work hard for it . it is really beautiful .
that was a pleasant surprise . it means i can have tea , instead .

gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .

i see . thanks a lot .
household appliance do not seem to last for a long time nowadays .
ok , got it . is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead ?
it is hard to say . while dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
it would be nice if the weather would never change .
i get what you mean .
do you know where that memo about office procedures is ? i want to give my secretary a copy .
good afternoon . i would like my hair done .
i am not being all that particular right now because i just need to keep a roof over my head .
we do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . but kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines .
sure , would you like anything else ?
son , it looks great on you .
all right . let is go .
you can check out two books at a time .
pretty good , sam . only the awful weather , you know .
well , i was hoping you would do me a big favor . that was supposed to be a rush order , i forgot to tell you . i am getting a lot of flak from my boss .
ms ling ! it is mr gwent , from montgomery computers .
what time are you leaving ?
i would like to , where ?
well , thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later .
thanks so much .
of course . we gave him a big carrot for a nose .

it is $ 60 here .
here is our brochure , ma'am . err ... full-size ... ok . please choose a model in this section .
ok . take care .
short messages will be kept in the short messages center . once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you cannot find them .
i am sure you will enjoy the trip . china is such a beautiful country .
you know .. i have a weakness for long dresses .
not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , are not you ?
what do most of the students do ?
how much is it ?
i never took that yet . if that was your favorite , i think i will check it out .
really ? it is a deal . have you ever been there ?
a lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like .
do not get drunk .
i will teach you .
they look delicious . i think she will be pleased .
have they set a date for the wedding ?
is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?
let me have a look . well , it contains basically all we have agreed upon .
but you should tell me you were in love with her .
thank you very much !
if i were you , i would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in .
that is everything .
women in particular . they are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress .
it is on fair oaks and orange grove .
very well , i will .
oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image .
if you are lucky , that might do the trick .
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . that is a real let-down .
ok . do you plan to go to america all by yourself or with your family ?
i cannot open the door .
that is ok .
let me check the computer . uh-oh , looks like your luggage is on its way to paris .
that will be all . you have been very helpful , thanks .
that is what i thought . it seems that he is been seeing someone else for about two months .
peter , it is a quarter to twelve . let is go home now !

i feel like things are already changing , because he was elected .
do you know what the weather will be tomorrow ? we are planning to climb the mountain .
the machine says your card was declined .
ok , ben and may , here we go . be careful , danny , the ball is coming . that is the green one .
the palace hotel they are taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i am sure they will do a good job .
i could not agree more .
the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project .
yes . what about you ?
well , i guess people who lived here before did not clean the bathtub .
ground beef would be fine .
of course , yes .
really , what is wrong with it ?
thanks . do you have a credit card , sir ?
here you are .
certainly , sir . we will keep it in the cloakroom for you . here is your number . when you leave , show it to the waiter behind the counter , please .

here you are .
after overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this .
where are you going ?
yes . see you then .
sorry , dave , i did not mean you . i am just not in the mood for this . i have work to do .
that is great . those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . they must be terribly disappointed if they do not win .
you are very modest and diligent . the distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . you deserve it .
many times . except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .
one kilogram , too .

all right . if you need any help , just let me know . my name is greg .
my understanding is that cif means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy .
oh , i am sorry i forgot all about it . well , can i take a rain check ?
indeed , no man can be perfect . he is just so-so in crashing the boards . usually he plays shooting guard . rebounding might not be his strong suit .
yes . i have get a small room .
dieting . it is the price we pay to make men notice us .
it will just take me a moment to cancel your account .
do not worry . i will help you eat it .
you are probably right . oh , what the heck ! i will take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
put it this way it was not cheap .
yes , but i do not really use it that often . have you ever used it ?
are your free this weekend ?
what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they are seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
oh , i would much prefer to go by car , then we do not need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
really ? wow with who ?
they do . once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it is only a two-seater , you know !
what is the problem ?
it sounds like she is pretty good-looking . does she wear glasses ?
i must weigh it first . err ... it is five grams over weigh , do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?

whoops . that is my pager . i had to get it for work .
i am afraid i have not had any experience in just this sort of work . i am studying business administration in college . i want to get a job that would tie in with my studies .
what size do you want the prints ?
would you like to try this one on ?
preferably at the big department stores .

is there a cheaper bus pass ?
sure . but you must show us the receipt . if something comes up , we will change it for you .
one of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work .

it is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them .
have you met my wife , mary ?
i am sorry . has it been bothering you ?
yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ?
well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone is mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution .
most of them live in the city . we provide free commuter buses for the workers . besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift .
right now i am basically just a secretary , but if i am given the chance , i want to become a travel agent there .

i did . did you ?
it is a pity they did not take the tele . we need a new one . anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company .
yes , it is fast . but four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage .
tell you what , i will be calling jim late this week anyway , so i will mention it to him then .
thank you very much .
there is no need . i will come back tomorrow .
well , you cannot blame them . it is a confusing ad .
i am not sure . i cannot agree , dan .
all these say a lot for their characters .
um yes , i would like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
is this the last thing that i will need to do before the house becomes mine ?
no , but if she has any questions , she can call me at 555-2345 .
i see . so , it is not for your company , it is for the prospective partner ?
and then i just sign here ? you are right ! it certainly is simple and extremely convenient .

so , it is the 27th teachers ' day .
i understand what you mean , and i will not upset myself . face it .
well , it will not if there no line at the pump .
that is easy .
not unless you lose about 100 pounds ...

when does it start ?
ok i will take three . what is the flight number ?
it does not matter , you should have called and let me know .
let me see . well , i would like onion soup . thank you .
sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
i said he was nothing but a yeoman .
before we discuss the price , may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
thank you for the invitation .
275 dollars is the lowest price i can offer .
the radio says it will be fine .
i never did either , but it pays the bills .
we will be eight or nine people . could we book a private room ?
thanks , but i do not want to put you into any trouble .
i think we should have a house cleaning today . what is your opinion ?
no , thank you .
well , i admit . the ghosts were scary .
i like that suggestion . show me one , please .
certainly sir . may i have your room key , please ?
i only need a single room .
i have been offered another job with higher salary . and it also gives me the opportunity of promotion .
you are smart .
you would better get up , or you will be late .
yes . cantonese food is lighter while sichuan food is spicy and hot .
it is just nerves . just play the right hand for now . one two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . good , good . do not forget the accidentals ! the key signature says that note should be a g-sharp b
are you busy now ?
so , have you been on the bus very long ?
nice to meet you , i am jim taylor .

i am not as familiar with it as i am with some of the older systems . but i am a fast learner and i can master it in a short time .
yet the argentine attacker is worth a bet .
thanks a lot .
that japanese restaurant , shogun , got good reviews .
can i use the clippers ?
it is 8 sharp by my watch .
oh , i think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father .
it is fun meeting new people .
do people get married young ?
great . i will take one .
are they ? in that case , i will be glad to give your money back .
i need to stand behind this shield . now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out .
a left girl ? what is that ?
about a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time .
i guess so .
what did you do after high school ?
i am not sure now . in any case , let is first make some careful investigations .
she is tall ?
that is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music .

why did not she call me ?
i am calling to cancel my reservation for trans pacific flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis . could you please make it for the same flight on august 2 instead of july 19 ?
yes . i think so . it is not a very expensive apartment . it is in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . the rooms are quite large too .
i beg your pardon ?
if you want spicy food , then i would recommend going to a thai , indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
around 30 minutes .
we have already got in touch with the underwriter . but they have refused to accept any liability . they attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage .
i thought you had trouble with clive !
i would like to meet him . will you introduce him to me ?
it is very light . that would be good . how is the battery life ?
i inform you of the problems . if there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems .

now with video rentals it is all a personal matter .
i have been coming here for the past few years .
i do , but if i do not have any credit in my phone , it will not let me call or send messages .
ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . you have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . and then attach them to your expense account . when you get back , our company will reimburse everything .

i think you are right , but it does seem that there are always a few co workers that are harder to work with than others .
do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
not just now , but if i do think of something later , i will give you a ring .

i will take this one . how much are they ?
i am calling to check your information before the interview . what position did you apply ?

what kind of case do you have ?
yeah . that was a strange party . can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ?
that is what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do not think it is proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor .
here is the programme . check it out yourself !
they look very uncomfortable .
it is a coupe with a vinyl roof .
no , some of them are my friend is . do you want her passport , too ?
correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
why do not you just get the basics ?
we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . in order to achieve this goal , i just want to work step by step .

thanks . i will call again when things get better at home .
i am really looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast !

i hope so , too .
there is a 20 percent service charge in this hotel .
yes , i noticed it yet .
let me see . we will try , but i am not sure that we can remove it .
we will fine you .
western and horror are the two types of movies i do not care for .
it is going to rain .
i watered all the plants .
did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
i know , but i really cannot accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
yes , sir . i will bring you a menu shortly after we take off .
well , drop by if you can .
try a stinger . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
wow , i did not know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history .
please put down the table in front of you . it is more comfortable that way .
did you have a certain movie in mind ?
and for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount .
no tipping ? now that is what i call a civilized system .
absolutely . i can decide when and what to do all by myself .
oh really ? it will be nice and warm there . have you been there before ?
mary , you must be careful . in some parts of america , the day can be - 10 c and sunny .
what about saturday ?
thank you , henry . i will get a number 13 .
you said all that on the first date ? alright ... well are you two going out again ?
do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ?
johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . my office number is 2123456 7 .
one way or round trip ?
we are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . do you like meeting the public ?
sweet and sour pro chops , madam .

a nice quiet house is exactly what we are looking for .
yes , here it is .
i will help you with that .

i would like to conduct some scientific research into genes . it would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough .

i am glad you like it .
i am happy to hear that , sir . your reservation is all set except for your phone number .
he had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked .
i am going there tomorrow .
by the way , how do you like to pay for it ? this hotel prefers cash .
they come to the earth ?
that sounds really good ! does it come with a soup ?
you will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due .
ok , i will take it .
yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand
i also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . i spent half of the weekend on a train ! surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
that is amazing ! really ? how could it change so much in two days ?
sorry , sally , it is not your fault .
what is up , robert ?
not at all . please sit down , then we can begin .
i am afraid it is empty .
yoga is used to promote people is physical , intellectual and mental harmony and healthy .

i give it away . here , this one is for you .
i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine .
this is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp is who are usually ministers . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
tomorrow is my wife is birthday . we both love spicy chinese dishes . i am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where i can find some good spicy dishes .
nothing but the best from my dad . i like everything about it except for the brakes . they are a bit sticky .
and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states ?
i am with hartford public relations . i would like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ?
but i definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 .
176 wooden street east .
i do not want to be like this . i think we should get step further .
in other words , the romans do what everyone else does .
let me introduce myself , by the way . my name is thomas bradley .
no , double nine zero two .
all right . do you know if the test covers the whole book ?
well , i would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !
no . the museum is the terminal of this bus .
i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just do not know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day .
well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . so you do not need to worry .

it is in the hall on the first floor .
you are free . you can go now .
it is a branch of the bank of america in beijing .
that is very nice of you .
that is only a joke . to be honest , i have to improve my english , because my english is not good enough . i still get confused about some simple grammars . since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ?
come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . there are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe .
i have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . for the past two years , i have been working in an investment banking . in addition to my analytical mindset , i have a background of solid accounting principles . i am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . i thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments .
i want to grow in my job and move ahead .
i almost did ! actually , i do not know that much about coffee , even though i sell it .
i hope this does not happen again .
ok . you have not seen my company car , have you ?
i do not think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time .
ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes .
yeah , you remember that assignment i wanted ? when i heard the manager had given it to someone else , i blew my top . so the manager fired me .
sure . so let is see . we need a piece of wood 3 . 5 m long by 1 m wide . i will order it right away and i will be able to install it next tuesday .
yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !
i am going to the central park . which train should i take ?
so what happened next ?
i would like to reserve a table for two , my wife and i .
yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that is not shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it is urgent .
it is my pleasure . how many copies would you want ?
does mark wyatt work there ?
oh , what a nightmare ! then what happened ?
oh , i would rather not .
i agree . that is why christopher is already looking for a job in maine , or wisconsin .
sure . i love this place , especially the decoration . so tasteful !
i am going there for a tour , too . is this your first trip to china ?
but there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history .
yes , your seat is confirmed on that flight . pls arrive at the airport one hour before departure .
yeah . it is hard to believe that it is been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
there is actually a documentary on the history channel later on that i would like to watch . do you want to stay and watch it with me ?

it was not that bad , and you are the one that insisted on skipping dinner . we went to an excellent restaurant .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
it is straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . it takes about 10 minutes .
why do you drink ? i mean , where does drinking get you ?
hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that is leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . maybe she is going to work or something and she does not want to go !
but i think eddy is going too far !

is that right ? we are very sorry .

i will fax you a schedule as soon as i contact the owners to confirm the times .
i do not think so . is that table all right ?
of course . it is common too that we wear something special for our chinese new year .
yes , that is true . your son is doing well at school , is not he ?
is it good ?
i have to go to court over a brake light ?
what is the climate like in your country ?
well , i will have a glass of mineral water .
i do not think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
but why ? why do not people like to buy shirts duty-free ? or shoes ? i just do not understand why it is always liquor .
what company is this for ? i mean where is the opening ?
my name is zhuang lingy . how are you , miss kelly ?
ok , are you already an account holder ?

yes , but not too stiff , right ?
so many stops ! do not you have any direct flights ?
that would be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ?
i think the inspection bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . as the amount in question is only 20 of the whole shipment , i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
thanks for understanding .
that is fine , thank you .
me ? i am in the car business .
our special tonight is lobster .

where do mangoes come from ?
the door bell does not work , the sink is leaking , there is no hot water , and the building is falling apart !
what else did you see ?
i do not like things to be fancy .
certainly . here you are .
i certainly have .
i have not been to the mall in a long time . let is go there .
ok , no problem . but you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time .
hum , do not say that . maybe you can do something useful for me .
that does look easy . i think i will make some tonight .
so you suppose you deserve a salary raise .

6 hours . if you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i am sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .
so i hear .
what is your problem ! geez . having a fit is not going to help !
is it useful for me ?
actually it is a common practice to overbook , as passengers often do not take their flight as scheduled . most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ?
i have learned english for 10 years , and i have passed college english test level 4 and 6 .
but number 13 buses leave from the centre of town . you will have to walk two miles to catch one .
first i want to look in the travel guide . maybe they do not have tours in the morning .

really , she is so pretty .
yes . it is one of the five mountains .

he is endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death .
i am pulling your leg , paul . i am a shopping queen , remember ? so of course i know what a garage sale is all about !
we cannot . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .

that is not fair , you got all the easy questions .
of course . in my opinion , you are the strongest candidate for the job .
it is been nice talking to you .
english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
because the company is far away from home , and i have to study after work so i cannot afford to waste time on the road everyday .
what about your step-brother is mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
to be honest with you , jason , i do not think i am doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . i am always two steps behind . i have got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . say ! why do not you talk to your advisor ? and let me know !

i did not have any big plans .
i am mary smith . nice to meet you , too .
the laundry has sewed on a new button for you .
what do you think about her as a boss ?
affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it is still a man is world .
well , these mediums are still important ... they are not a thing of the past ... but i think they might be less important now than in the past . the technology age has arrived !
but of course ! well , it is been great talking to you , but i have to get going .

it is a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
that is to say , most it professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . i am wondering why it companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead

so romantic . young people must have lot of fun .
why not ? see .
i was in charge of cost price and sales revenue .

well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like beijing . i think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . bicycling home after work can help release your stress . life in the offices is miserable . you just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . why do not you give a full play to your energy after work ? enjoy the speed on the road . just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . how great !
oh , that is nice . thank you for arranging all of this .
well , it is because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
maybe we can try yuanyang pot this time . you can choose the non-spicy soup base .
we will see .

good morning , this is jane . this is apple co . ltd .
we have a problem with our roof . can you come and have a look ?
i think the file is too big . you will need to expand your memory . first , close down all the files you have open , and then ...
so , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . got it .
good morning . i would like to pay my bill .
i just wanted to give you the good news .

i just enjoy watching games .
i am sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do ?
i do not know . i just was not thinking .
yes . i am sure i could find something similar at one . i would also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .
i am looking forward to seeing westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like isaac newton , the great mathematician and winston churchill , the great wartime leader .
yes , i am afraid i bought the last ticket , and to think , if you had not been such a gentleman ...
the sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . he said everybody at webtracker used them .
all you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the continued claim form , and the edd office will take care of the rest .
you will not pay anything until your cable starts working again .
that is to keep the price down , i suppose . i will take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they have got to say about this .
of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ?
ok , let is have a try .
yeah , but come on , geoff , as if you do not check facebook at work . look , you hired this guy , we have invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it is up to you to coach him . make it work , geoff !

certainly , sir . what would you like done to them ?
what is the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ?
well , let is order one for starters .
what information will i need to provide to apply for unemployment ?
how about winter ?
ok , i will try her back then .
because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . so i figure you would study even harder after you have got in .
oh , we are skillful in doing that . you can trust us . our shop has a history of more than 20 years .
sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
i prefer going by train , ever though it costs more .
i am sorry , i am very tired . i am going to bed early . i did not have good time , and i do not really want to see you again .
yeah , that would be great . thanks .
could i have your name , please ?
did it ever shrink or fade ? generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually .
or what only we are able to give them .
you are quite welcome . thank you for calling . bye-byeb
just follow the foot movements . brush left , brush right ... yeah ! that is it !
yes , i believe they are . here are something that might interest you .
alright , i will get it .
you know , i could do this myself . why do not you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ?
how should i know ? it is just kind of cold in the middle . it just does not taste right . do you want to try it ?
i thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ?
why would you keep it ?
well , we want to have the largest share . our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer .

oh , maybe not . it is just your guess . do not give currency to idle gossip .
i have been feeling pretty ill for a few days now .
and here is the seven of the clock news it is only seven of the clock . your watch is fast .

i have got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
it is still early .
that is true . here are some samples of hairstyles . what do you think about this one ?
do you find that one works better than the other ?

here we are ' withdrawal ' , so i just press here ?
there is no one moderating it . anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . the information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . a lot of people get conned online .
i see , that is a long time . how much was the watch ?
i need the haircut . but you seem so busy today .

it was not . it was birdseed . we do not throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it .
i have always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
i am glad to know that you like her .
you do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
really ? how could you do that ? do not you save every couple minutes ?
but remind you , there are some forbidden activities .
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open-air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just now i was told by my chinese colleagues i bought it overpriced . i could have talked my way to thirty .
it was in the living room .

that depends . our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . the fixed asset loan is a long-term loan , you see . the loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs .
no need to worry about that . the cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care .
sure . i will also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .
every so often . it is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores .
it is got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . it is also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . it is absolutely amazing !
nine would be perfect . i will see you then !

we need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . i believe in portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . i will look in the yellow pages . i would like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green .
as far as the language is concerned , it is worth reading .
that is a good point . car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .
well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but i think it is backfired . the immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise .
oh , do you know why ? actually , it is easy . because i always exercise . my exercise , i think , is very hard . i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . i feel alive !
mr . : for those of you who do not have a calculator , get one .

let me have a look at the receipt .
we would like to sign a year-long contract , if that is ok .
we want what we call a clean sample . urinate a drop or so into the toilet , and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup .
i know . every day the weather seems different .
no , you also need a boarding pass .
i would like to have a hamburger .
when do you need them , sir ?
thank you , mr . black . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . mr . smith will be in charge during my absence . he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . take it easy . it will be ok soon . you see , i take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy .
that is a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food .
sorry , mr . black . i am trying to make them quiet .
oh , hi jeremy . no please , go ahead . so how are you , jeremy ? i was talking to linda about you only last week .
myoma ? what is that ?

i cannot wait anymore . when does the performance start ?

certainly . ok , got you .
according to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . i think my background meets the requirement of this position .
but we made it .
it should be easy to find . after you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet .
sure . wait , wait . does a lid come with this pan ?
i usually have the wrong notion that he is very serious .
let is sign the registry . the realtor looks kind of busy right now .
just fill out this application . we can let you know right away if you qualify .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
i am not sure where they sell bus passes at .
well , i have bought a lot of meat . i have got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties .
do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ?
that is a good idea .
hey , chill out , i am just trying to help .
all right , mr . cook . i will have mr . baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
if it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
how sweet of them ! i have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . i really hope i have eight arms and legs , like an octopus .
one second , sir , while i print out your receipt . here you are .
i hope that you had good journey .
i know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?
are there any other cities where it is always hot ?
in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier .
i was not all that impressed by the food .
morning sally ! what is up ? you seem many hurry !
you should not grab someone else is shirt . that is a foul .
oh , so he is half chinese and half american . that is unusual . what languages does he speak , then ?
oh , i am not certain , but i think i have lost it .
did you see his last dive ?
what finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ?
yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you are really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
well , we have got several point-and-shoot cameras . these are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash . we also have these polaroid cameras .
but i am told that you dance wonderfully well .
i am proud of you for standing by her . i think you have helped make a big difference in her life .
is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
but i also want ya to do me a favor .
where do i go to pick up my ballot ?
she is always behaving herself , and she is so smart .
yes , that is the ticket ! and if i need to print something there ?
wow , i did not know ! probably because i flunked history in school .
speaking , who is calling please ?
yes , it is . please put your luggage on this scale .
right . look , why do not we make a list of the problems we are dealing with . it will be easier to work through them that way .
are these your bags ?
should we put our samples on this table ?
ok . i have set it up for you .
so how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
hi , susan . what is up ?
believe it or not , the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers .
they should . this holiday is about remembering our war dead . but people these days think it is just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts !
you should just ask the bus driver for a transfer .
that is good .
how old is she ?
i like talking to you too .
i hope so . then i will be the happiest person in our office too !
i would like to leave a few minutes early today . would that be all right ?
the first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . about the second problem , i admit it is our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample .
office address , please . he might be at work when they arrive .
i got it from an encyclopedia .
that should not be a problem .
4 persons altogether .
it is just one exam . can you re-take the exam ?
well ... i am going away on sunday morning . very early . will the party go convery late ?
how long have you been sick ?
i like people who are open and friendly . those people are usually more active and fun to be with . i like spending time with my friends . we go to bars together or play sports together .
i like it a lot but i need to talk with my wife . can you hold it for me for two days ?
what a pity !
can i leave a message for him please ?
thanks a lot .
it is only a pin prick . i have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find .
look , dear . it is over there .

i have made a mistake ?
do not , do not , do not , do not say that . that , that makes it worse .
i will make sure he receives the message .

i really wish it was not so hot every day .
first , i will clean up the wound and then dress it .
fine , the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the internet job listing sites . see them over there ?
great . good luck .
and what would you like for dessert ?
by the way , miss . where is the toilet ?
the file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible .
and my new car . to think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . that is what hurts me most .
you are so thoughtful . thank you .
it is too high . i cannot reach it . could you help me ?
i have all the information in this folder .
that may be true . but i am sure you are able to find a balance between them . why not try it ?
which kind do you want ?
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them .
i do not agree . i think the capitol building is the most famous . but okay . if you want to see the white house , we will go see it . i am just afraid it will be boring .
well , i think it is the time to pull the plug .
perfect ! could not be better .
i want it enlarged to 5 inches .
oh , you look stunning . your dress really goes well with your shoes .
by the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
certainly . please wait a moment . here is your bill .
i am in room 215 .
what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?
yes , of course . what is your telephone number ?
could you run over to the store ? we need a few things .
not to me , i would not be caught dead in that .
fine ! do you want anything to eat now ?
boy , i am sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you would like to make a deal ?
well , do not be late . i will see you on friday at helen is .
what does it say ? do you think he will see it ?
oh . that is a pity . i thought that we might go hiking in the hills .
do not worry . we can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them .
oh , what a coincidence ! i bet bobby must be very happy about it . he likes children and always wants a child of his own .
sure i am . but he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' .
yes . i like winter .
i think that i would like to order the broccoli noodles , please .
when will we get one of those ?
i guess you are right . and we would like to have company anyway .
i liked it . i did not think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly were not uninspiring , in my opinion .
is that so ? we are using lures , and the fish are biting those too .
yes , mr . chen . here you are .
are you serious ?
yes . i am here to apply for the job of director that your company posted yesterday . is it still available ?
we share the same bathroom , in other words .
aright . have fun on saturday .
sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here .
ok . thanks for asking me .
sure . first of all , it is very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually do not think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . but auctioning on ebay is risky .
i am happy to hear you say that .
i am afraid you are right . recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath .
mary , this is mr . wu , my new chinese friend .
wow ! this was a lot easier than i thought !
it should be under leslie smith . the number is 184796 a .
i am supposed to be going to shanghai .
well allen is a great student . he is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .
what about the quality ?
yes , i did .
about 40 percent , if he speaks slowly . when he speaks fast , i can only catch a word here and there . but mr . wang is an excellent chinese teacher . with his help , my chinese is getting better and better e
oh , no ! did you call the police ?
ok . let me send a memo around .
no . you do not have to pay duty on personal belongings .
i said , do you want me to help you ?
it is ok . my boss briefs me later on .
good . you really know how to enjoy yourself .
i used to hold a similar job for six years .
you cannot mail it in early because you do not know , in advance , how much you will be working .
janice , david , come here . we take some photos here . i cannot imagine how beautiful it is !
they still live in shanghai where i was born .
a little , but the rush was worth it .
i am not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
yes , i kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost .
i know it , but i do not know when i can make it better .
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
yeah . i think things are worked out just fine .
i watched the race with my children . we saw you run to the finish line . we all screamed with excitement .
then , how about this room with just a shower ?
i see . but , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking americans .
so , are you still going to have cereal ?
oh , about 10 miles . it takes me about an hour .
no , that should be it . thank you !
do you really think so ?
i have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . a-bout two months after i began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . she encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . so i was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . of course , i made certain that she knew what i had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because i gave her summary reports , although she did not specifically ask me to . without her support and encouragement , i do not think i would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . but she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . when i submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . she then took my revised proposal to her boss . he was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try it for several weeks . he did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . i have also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . and while i would certainly prefer to work for one like i have just described , i am the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .
yes , i know . i tried that . they do not have anything now . so what can i do ?
that is a good idea .
oh , i am so tired . my back is sore and my neck hurts .
we are glad that you are here . would you like a tour of the house ?
i will tell you what . you can get a motorcycle on one condition .
come on , hugh ! tea is for wimps ! please , i need your help .
no , mum , i would rather stay inside .
that is because americans love sitcoms .
ok . ok . i do not want to haggle with you . let is say , how about 3 . 5 ?
i am not being nosey . i am just asking .
that is true . many people from the south do not like the weather here .
what i can tell you is that i voted for our next president of the united states .
we still have more to go , i think .
yes , i have .
sorry , i do not think i can .
it will be held on october 15th .
then you will be in line for a doom .
you can go to zhongshan park .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it is not all good news . they have been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
what are you unhappy with ?
what is the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
would you like to go with me ? i am afraid of the hospital .
wow ! that is interesting ! it must be tough !
you are talking to her .
how much more are you thinking ?
may i ask whether we need to work overtime ?
come on , sit down , and let me have a look .
10 minutes later . hi . here are completed forms .
my skin is kind of oily .
ah , yes . the italians do love the sensual forms of the human body .
how are you feeling today ?
what about the jeans ?
that is what pam said .
but did not you say that his dad takes him under his wings ?
i will not make any noise . mom , please .
i would prefer wine . you ?
as much as possible .
tell me when you want me to teach you .
i am afraid i must . look at it ! it is terribly dry .
well , actually , i am thinking about living off campus .
i will tell them .
here is 200 .
you mean i have to wear the same thing every day ? mom !
i am making a shopping-list , tom .
do not move from time to time . it is very impolite and will make you nervous .
alright . and what is your major ?
did she ask you any questions about your family ?
i cut it on that blade .
to conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7 a.m . till 10 .
i was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .
indeed . online banking enables you to make on-line shopping .
as long as you do not treat it better than your wife , it is fine .
oh , good . how old is your niece ?
be careful ! the road is muddy . you might slip .
that is good . we hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy .
ok , i will try later . thanks anyway .
i slept like a baby . i fell asleep right away last night , did not wake up once , and did not have nay nightmares !
after you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . if you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .
i am not very familiar with chinese cuisine . what can you recommend ?
do you have any mixed drinks available here ?
thank you . you can rest assured that we will do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . however , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions .
i think i have the cash . let me check . yes , here you are .
well , how about fifty percent discount ? if so , i will buy that fur coat .
i know it does , and that is because it is .
it would be better if you watched out for yourself . i might forget .
why ? we can leave school earlier that day .
they usually do .
i will pay attention to my handwriting next time .
what kind of volunteer work ?
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
when shall we go and look ?
in a month .
i really love you .
yeah , i suppose you would not want to see that , huh ?
how many shifts are there in your factory ?
do you have any homework today ?
do not you hit it off ?
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it is so terrible .
how high was your temperature yesterday ?
i was laughing through the whole movie .
well , i own a house . actually , i am leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i am employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks ' vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march .
that is easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
you can choose a short-term or yearly rental .
shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ?
i will show you .
i cannot disclose that information .
oh jackie ? we broke up last week .
there have been charges made on my debit card that i did not make .
i was . it is just that the holidays are coming up and i will not be able to home because i cannot afford the airfare . i am just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom is cooking and being around my family .
i can still remember our first date .
a lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up .
i know this characteristic of him . so i never think seriously of his words .
oh , i am sorry , but there are a couple of different places i will travel to within the united states , so i was not sure what to put .
that is one option , madam . if your are travelling to either hong kong or macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 usd for you .
there are so many ancient relics in china .
it is 86 coach and 175 berths
the woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds .
i have heard about it , but i do not really know about it .
all kinds , but mostly pop , rock and classical . why ?
it is really a small world , is not it ! the hammer family is not very big .
no . edith did not give anything to drink .
no , thank you . i do not have time . how much is that ?
i am afraid she is in a meeting at the moment . who is speaking ?
may i have a glass of red wine , please ?
yeah , i have got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff .
when will she be back ?
ok , i will tell him .
i am waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park .
will you need all of them right away or can some wait ?
it depends on the job . it is actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we do not use very often .
i might try it myself .
yes , we do . they are all in this book .
see you then .
can i choose the home inspector ?
no problem . that happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
ok . let me call you later . is that okay ?
the usual minimum purchase is 5,000 rib .
oh dear . well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future .
kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this friday ?
and vegetables with porridge .
oh , my jump rope . mom , can you get it for me ?
could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? i mean , those dos and do nots . i am a green hand , you know .
yes we are going towards westminster abbey . i can see it now ! look to your right .
it is because montreal is a bilingual city .
that is not good . you do not have a well-balanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
oh . would you like some soup instead ?
i will appreciate it so much .
i am sure they are wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
you cannot be serious !
i will enjoy seeing you have a good week !
i never know how to rate the employees ' work . of course attendance and productivity are easy , i just look at the sales figures .
i am going to put on more clothes , too .
i usually take the five thirty home .
i had no idea there were a set of instructions . i thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !
no . do not be silly . i would not dream of letting you do that .
they are beautiful .
the funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let is transfer it .
why do you say that ?
he is in his bedroom . he has been in a bad mood after school .
thanks . hey , look at that guy over there . i think he fancies you .
yes . he was excellent . they worked well together .
oh , really ? maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
as obnoxious as bean is , we should still try to finish this case .
yes . i am just waiting until i officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
will you exfoliate the skin as well ?
she is beautiful . what is the price for digital barbie ?
you owe $ 24 . 50 in late fees .
i hope that the test results show me to be really healthy .
will i be informed when my friend gets the letter ?
did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview ?
really ? that is really wonderful . i am so happy for her .
will you ever get another copy ?
honey , that is my pinkie . the ring goes on the ring finger !
go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee .
you are always be the most beautiful one in the world . what is the bridemaid is name ?
oh . it is too late . maybe i should go to other video stores to have a look .
you will be fined .
that is good .
i know , but another pair cannot hurt .
yes , i do .
may i have your name and telephone number ?
you get off at the next stop , cross the street , and you will find the stop not far on the right hand side .
when we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ?
no , why should i ? i do not feel like it . besides , i am in such a bad mood .
no . he is afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did .
yes , i can . i do not ride regularly though . how about you ?
i think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .
i love it . all my life i wanted to learn to ski . finally i took lessons last year .
sure . firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . interviewers usually do not think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic .
call me john . this is a great area of the city for shopping . there is a grocery store just around the corner .
i am impressed . good for you !
just a moment , sir . let me check the reservation list . sorry , i am afraid we are fully booked tonight . would you like to make a reservation some other time ?
yes , sometimes the differences are great .
you are crazy . gambling is against my principles .
it is about an hour is drive .
the market price for tong house is around five thousand hong kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house .
yes , it is not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy .
oh , no , he likes the job .
who did you vote for ?
yes , but i am not feeling very better now . actually i am feeling even worse .
who would not ? wow , that is out of this world .
as to packaging , we will pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton .
sure . you can buy almost anything you can think of .
we will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m . any more questions .
okay . it looks like rain .
thanks a lot .
can you recommend some popular tour ?
that is a problem . he has sort of dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything .
the show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 of the clock p.m .
okay . do you have a particular size in mind ?
i am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
what happens now ?
no kidding ! did not you study for it ?
i think i can work well under pressure , if necessary .
i want some chocolate .
yes , of course . do you want to join the day tour or the night tour ?
that is why i like department stores more . shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things i am unable to grow accustomed to .
that is why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , is not it ?
i can play the piano a bit .
good . are you going to the pub tonight ?
i hope so . thank you again for your delightful gift .
yes , i know .
well , i will see . sometimes the stores do not have some of the new kinds of cereal .
uh ... , i am not even married yet . how about this brown dried fruit ?
could you tell me something about it ?
and a roman really ioves life . eye knows how to enjoy himself .
it is not cheesy ! it is romantic . when it first came out , i saw it in the theaters five times in one week .
to the front desk .
thank you . i have to leave now . if you see pamela , tell her i will write to her .
what do you want ?
well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case .
let is just sit in the back . we can still hear the service from here .
i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i could not express myself the way i wanted to .
i have got it . i will not bother you any more . you would better hurry to do it , christmas is just around the corner .
stay just a few minutes longer , ok ?
sure . this is claire .
this should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
you can get del or dial-up .
i do not know what to make .
what are their names ?
hang on a second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !
thanks , mom . can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake .
if you know any of their friends . you cannot rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . you have to go out and make the first move sometimes . i also like funny people .
it is a great feeling .
they detained you at the station ?
i do not find a carol in the computer for today . i have a carol larson here . but that reservation is for next monday .
i do not think so . you must compare our price with that of other export houses . i am sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
what is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
great ! what floor is pharmacy on ?
i almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on sundays .
how about going to the suburbs ?
ok . where shall i pay duty for it ?
do you want to take milk and sugar ?
are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ?
i suppose you are right , lee . maybe that is why so many westerners are overweight .
well , the reason why i am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . and the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back .
that means the apartment has furniture in it .
yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
i have just changed my plan .
yes , the sun shines day after day . it is neither too hot nor too cold .
thank you very much . i really had a good time .
well , i thought it was not that serious .
you are too strict with yourself .
yes . natural pearls or cultured pearls ? we have both kinds .
here you are .
well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler is check buying rate , for which we are somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . you see , hotels really are not in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler is check for their guest .
i know . if a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined .
i think you are right . i think we have a very good athletics team . they should do well in the olympics . how many medals do you think we will win ?
i could not agree with you .
so it is the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?
that will probably take care of your symptoms . i will see you tomorrow .
what about in china ? what would you do to celebrate your birthday ?
no , you can learn a lot from them .
hi , this is kalina from your morning literature class .
ok , got it .
yes , sir , go ahead , here you are .
well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . it is the closest you can get to flying .
if so , counter strike and might magic are good alternatives . counter strike is one of the hottest shooting games and might magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes .
nice to meet you , mrs . smith . i am coming here for an interview by appointment .
which sons do you want to go to ?
how long has this been happening ?
sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily .
800 yuan a month .
yes , we are a foreign-invested company .
thanks a lot .
c :: four by six will do .
why the drama ? have you been watching soap operas ?
i do not want to miss it today .
i prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash .
it is fashionable .
anything else today ?
who is ellie ?
are you kidding ? whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ?
i will be coming over to look at it this afternoon . will you be there ?
i see . how do you control the quality ?
my left arm .
could i have your name , please ? and do you know your card number ?
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
yeah , i think so ! i pledged phi iota alpha , so i am living at the frat house now .
do not be absent-minded even when you are not interested in the talk .
no , thanks . a taxi is just fine .
my older sister judy will be here soon to help . she already has a boy and a girl of her own ...
service technician . how can i apply for this position ?
i want to inform you of the interview .
i really like the food .
it is ok . i will leave the pamphlet here . if you need more information , you can call me any time .
what are you doing in this neighbourhood ? do you live around here ?
i will have an application form with me . you can fill it out if you are interested .
what are the purposes of contract ?
i am sorry to hear that . anything i can do for you ?
good evening , mr . smith .
yes , i do . i do not like it very much .
oh , i see .
yes , i am . could i have the bill , please ?
i asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone .
where can i get it ?
nine would be good , do not you think ?
it is not what it appears . i actually tried harder in the 101 class . if i put as much effort into the 201 class , i would have received the same grade .
excuse me , ma'ma . could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
i like the freedom of summer with no school .
it is not a surprise , is it ? she has always been a hard working student .
here you are .
no doubt about it . shopping online will get more and more popular . it is a real revolution about people is consuming habits .
let me check . yes .
what kind of change , just in prices ?
i like the fact that i get to work with people . it makes the day go by much faster .
but your company is huge . cannot they afford to pay the staff decent wages .
what was your gpa before this semester ?
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
that will not be possible today .
i can do that .
what size of prints would you like to have ?
i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him .
great . thank you .
what is a good exercise for my chest muscles ?
that would be great . what kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?
now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? we should not sunbathe all day .
it belongs to the past . he lost his job the other day , and he is up a tree now .
i have got three guests today . we would like a table next to the window .
that is a little steep for our company . do you offer any discounts ?
i do not think it is right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
i would like to know why you are always taking credit for work we have done together like that line in the new ice cream ad ?
well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . it must have cost a lot .
oh , yes , here it is .
where are we ? oh , here we are . so we drive to the a120 and turn left .
yes , you can see every test for the past five years . you can compare them .
nothing but the best for a pretty woman !
the godfather and the godfather ii , of course . they were both directed by francis ford coppola .
ok , but do not delay too long , or that trip will be all booked .
yes . have a look .
only 3 ? that is not much . if you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products .
where else have not i been to yet ?
do you have any carry-on luggage ?
20-30 . but we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . that is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery .
really ? why is that ?
and can i have some ketchup , please ?
i want to create a password for this document . please tell me how to do it .
here is my passport . and this is the declaration form .
i am sorry , i cannot .
yes . i am calling to make sure if flight cg877 will arrive on time ?
are they urgent , please ?
only about twenty minutes .
what currency would you like to trade in ?
that is fine .
thank you . please come again .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china .
not a bit of it , do not blame yourself .
if you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . would you still want full coverage ?
do not be sad . everything will be fine .
you are right . did you say 5: 30 ? i will make a note of it . fine .
thank you . oh , it tastes nice .
i am afraid i never go for a holiday . it is always business .
that will be fine . and i can promise you that you will get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order .
you may ask questions about us , if you have any .
it does not matter much . if it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be ok .
sorry , i made a mistake . they are on the right side of the tv .
are there any good programs on tv ?
not necessarily . i think people would be impressed by your language abilities . it says something about your level of intellect and experience . also , i think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
yes , it is a macintosh . it is apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
well , each room is 40 dollars a week .
have a good day at school ! see you tonight !
what is the problem ?
look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , i am thinking about buying one .
just me this time .
allow me to give you a hand .
and where are you from , jack ?
what does it say ?
here you are . thank you and have a nice evening .
he did not say , but he said he would call me .
you should have told me earlier . i am a cookie lover .
let is get back to you . how was your day ?
thanks a lot for your help .
how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? has not it been driving you carry being without a phone ?
and what is montreal like ? what did you think of it ?
if you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner .
yes , too good to be true .
that is very late . can the dentist see me now ?
i am glad you like it .
yeah , you are right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky .

well , there is that , yes .
i think i am doing great , except for that one test !
i am sorry to hear that . well , i heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women .
we could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 reduction is really more than we can do . what quantity are you going to order from us then ?

i am all set . he can come anytime .
one person ? how about your girlfriend ?
sure . i am going to take more pictures today .

i am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . but you might be lucky at our branch .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
yes . that is why i am here .
we have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . we can take coffee breaks during the day . my boss does not mind , as long as we get our work done on time .

it is wrong because , it is not true .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
my hands are full . cannot you see that ?
oh no ! what shall i do ?
shall i make out a receipt ?
well , they sent me their prospectus , so i can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?
no problem . i will tell you about our alternatives .
what a shame ! you should have showed yourself to them !
great ! and remember , a taxi , not a limo .
but i do not like playing the piano . and the homework keeps me busy enough .
yes , but it is much smaller .
that is very nice of you . i guess i could use some help .

no , thanks .
i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ?

bob is retiring , wow ... that is news to me , i had no idea bob was that old , retirement is still sixty-five , right ?
yes . you can use your textbook for your reference .
that is fine . i will have a try .
no , they did not . the chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting .
well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . we are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . the market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . if we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . it is a real mess .
thank you . thanks to the baker , i benefit a lot from him .
that is ok .
nice to meet you . my name is sophie .
is there any water damage ?
of course . where are you planning to travel to ?
well , i am already in this field and know most of the companies . before i come in to fill out an application , i need to know who it is with so i know whether or not i am willing to work with them .
it is on the first floor .
nothing that i can think of right now . if something comes up , though , i will call you .

how do you get along with others ?
i will be back late tonight .
regrettably , no . but simply present your visa to cover your deposit .

oh yeah ? tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?
have you watched the tv series , humble abode ?
no . do we need tickets ?
working under pressure is exciting and challenging . i do not mind . in fact , i am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work .
yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it is necessary .
all right , then . there is one at the new concert hall .
i will go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . thanks .
it is kind of a big favor . i am absolutely flat broke , and i owe my landlady $ 200 . she is given me until friday to give it to her , but i do not get paid until next monday . do you think you could loan me some cash until i get paid ?
i would love to try some snacks .

when are you returning home ?
well , they ' ve got the money and she is going tomorrow for treatment .
let is see . yes , here are your passports back . did you pack your luggage yourselves ?
really ? why we must have warm and fresh water ?
i have never experienced such a kind of feeling .
walk that way for about four blocks . the hotel is about two blocks north of there .
would not you ? what would you do with all that spare time ?
i have an offer to work for a company in your city today ?
i am not very particular about the design . but i want something of good quality .
i would like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
that is unbelievable .
yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ?
she is miao li . she is come here to see her brother .
who cares ? it is just online . it is not real . do you want to join me tonight ?
i have been going to graduate school at usc .
you are right . let is stop idling around and do something .
have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? it is loaded with all kinds of items .

i know , and i will .
i understand . thank you .

is he still in that that type of work .
really ? congratulations !
he said his present job seemed to be a blind alley .
i did not think much of it . are you ?
hmm . he might really appreciate that . i know he will start to collect movies at school . especially if he studies film .
well . you know i hate walking , but i cannot wait to see your guys ' video .
i have got a fever and a very sore throat .
i love children , as you know , so probably a children is charity .
mr . sandals , may i see your id , please ?

i really recommend you go for a run in the morning .
oh , yes . we will give you a 5 commission on every transaction .
yes . i am going to give you some . take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . for that one , two tablets . and remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you .
is this ann ?
i am worried that i messed up on a test .
do you have your medical history sheet with you ?
how do you spell your last name , mr . eakins .
is it under warranty ?
yeah , i am going to be making phone calls all day . what a blast .
most women follow fashion like sheep . they do not know any better than imitate .
is there anything else at the edd offices to help me with my job search ?
let is see ... these numbers are off the charts ! what is going on here !
but i do not know what else i can do . i am willing to work hard . sometimes i make mistakes and the boss is not happy .
it goes all the way there .
thanks . but do not forget that they have a vet appointment this saturday .

hey , that sounds great .
we need a new filing cabinet in the office . could you go downtown with me after lunch ?
just go and make a list for me , please .
absolutely . take my word for it .
my hair looks hideous .
no . you can never count on the grown-ups when there is something .
yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . we would have to insist on the annual contract , however . i understand it is not the most convenient for you . perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate .
do you want to know where i got mine from ?
yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
i am a little bit shy and i blush every time i speak in public . i think i should open myself more and be more outward with people .
that would be great ! is it expensive ?
thank you very much .
i have just contacted our technicians . they say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . can you tell me your factory is address , so they can find you easier ?
if i could , i would like to view the apartment sometime today .
i remember i saw when i was dining in the aidan restaurant . when i paid the bill , i saw it in my handbag .
it is out of the question .
i want to ask you a couple questions .
no , i just need the sheets .
yeah , i saw that . i thought you were playing a game with them .
i think a surprise party may be better . but i forget when her birthday is .
it must be old .
that is very expensive for the family of the bride .
where did you buy it ?
everything looks so good . is there anything in particular that you recommend ?
which model is the best seller of this year ?
he is an accountant . i have been helping him for a week .
where are they from ?
whoa whoa whoa ! are you nuts ? how much is all this going to cost ? i am looking at the price at each one of these little things and it is outrageous ! this is basically a crayon !
except housework , that is .
i want to check in .
not this taiwanese girl . we do not like to get suntans .
this is sure to be a worthwhile read .
i have never seen those before , but since you are so excited it should be good .
you are very lucky to have such a nice family .
i will put the song at the front of the list .
no . do you have a car ?
what is it ?
well , it certainly makes everything easier , both at this end and at your end .
i missed today is weather for cast in the radio
here you are . here you go . we have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , french fries and icecream for dessert . eating chicken while it is hot . it tastes better .
how do you like this waltz ?
hi , martin . what can i do for you ?
that is great . will i feel hot there ? i feel sensitive to heat .
you can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars .
all right . have a good night .
do you really think so ? i do not . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ?
yeah , but that is human nature .
i am sorry i do not like it is a little too salty .
i did not plan on cooking tonight .
it just happened to be the highest grade in the class .
mr . : as soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement .
that was an odd change of subject .
okay , thank you very much for your help .
why would you have to do that ?

and you think about her all the time ?
it will not work . i am nowhere close to being tired .
i know what you mean , i have thought about that myself .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
frankly yes . we like to employ married people . by the way , do you have any children ?
oh , i need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight .
my mother works in a company as an accountant .
um , very nice . it is warm in spring and cool in autumn .

why not go the youth restaurant ? you will have a happy lunch there .
that is right .
i do not have the slightest clue .
we cannot judge a man totally by that .
yeah , i think i will go .
yes , the roasted vegetable salad is good , and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice .
it would be good for both if they lived separately . my parents want to live apart from us .
i will have the kung pao chicken , please .
maybe she will make a famous singer in the future .
i would like that , but i am flying home this afternoon , and i told my parents i would meet them at the airport for lunch .
i hope so .
before i verify those , i need you to fill in some forms . then , as i said , i need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ...

those tow games are quite different . first , there is the size of the teams . in football , a team has 11 players . in rugby there are 15 players on each team . the biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . in rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .

great . thanks a lot .
are you kidding me ? how could he behave like that ?
haha . that is probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent . and the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . such games are quite pleasing to the eye .

according to what you did last time , i have my doubts .
i work for an internet company .
no . i only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible .

another problem is that i dare not look into their eyes whenever i meet strangers , especially foreigners .
i want you to cut it to a few inches long .
i am skeptical . mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . it is so different from what we have on earth , you know .
yes . let me get you a pair .
your name , please .

thanks . i could eat a cow .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people do not seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes .
o . k. well , go to google . com , and type in battle of gettysburg .
certainly . there are several kinds of music . what do you like to listen to ?
i guess it is because the chinese women are more attractive to western men .
settle down , elvin . if you are not careful , you will give our plan away . zina is smart , you know .
honey , it does not matter . the key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other .
yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently .
that sounds like a very quick meal .
it could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard .
now let me take your measurements .
for whom ? cortex ?
exactly what type of ground beef do you want ?
i must weigh it .
it is either $ 850 or nothing at all .

ok . see you then .
that is exactly how i felt .
hi , troy . how is your trip going ?
certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ?
thanks . i understand what to do now .
yes , you are right . either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . in such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible .
certainly . the service cart will be down the aisle again soon .
and sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks .
ok . i never forget it .
either way , i only allow one missed assignment per semester . when will you be turning the make-up in ?

yes , that will be easiest .
and the plot is so simple .
it is all right . there are so many christians in america that everybody takes it for granted that i am christian .
no , not that much . and yes , that ' fine .
well , i hope you can find something else to be passionate about .
yes , i will have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please .

so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
not too long . cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
well , i do not think so .

two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long-distance running ?

i am attending hebes university of technology .
she is alright .
where do you live ?
hey , it is not that bad . the food is nutritious and it is really convenient . i do not want to spend too much time on eating stuff .
you can say that again .
i am the accountant with go thong computers .
we can make some special arrangement if we need to . after all , it is the company who is footing the bill .
no , he does not . but his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time . incredibly , he has many different girlfriends . starting almost right after they married 20 years ago .
is your country is environment being damaged by the oil industry ?
well , it is important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . i would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . it will really help a lot .
that sounds great . i am absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
not really . sometimes , i even let other people make key decision for me .
i am going to add a second drug for now , lisinopril , which is an ace inhibitor .
it might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . the stockholders are our investors . they own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company .
great . then call me and let me know if she is free .
i think you will like them . my family is pretty laid back .
yes . i have come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing , and pear has been falling behind in the market .
yes , of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
looking at the spice rack , i would say you have been learning how to make asian food .
it is a traditional family . it may be too large to live well .
thank you for calling us . we will be expecting you next monday .
sir , tell us about your experience with super bulk-up .
may i see that x-ray again ?
i am sure of what i am doing .
so how have you been lately ?
i am not feeling very well . i have got a bad cold .
i see . how long will you need it ?
yes , it is all right . shall we say two in the afternoon ?
really ? are you sure ?
i cannot tell you that .
well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . do not you think ?
i do . i do not know what to do after i retire . i would like to work till i drop .
i have everything right here . i will let you go through that and come back . i would like to have a good read of your materials to make sure i make the right choice .
small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms .
this is outrageous ! i am never coming back to this hotel again !
i do not know . but i have a carsickness .
that is too bad . do you have any foreign teachers ?
i am sorry but i cannot make the final decision myself , and i have to discuss it with other interviewers .
i also need to check this magazine out .
well , yes , but now we have six offices in california alone .
oh my god , do not you know that such living environment is not healthy ?
at least five channels have morning cartoons on saturdays .
i saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .
we can certainly give you faster turn around , but it will cost you extra .
actually , i would like a booth by the window if that is possible .
that is terrible . do many people die in tornadoes ?
here it is . and how much rib shall i get ?
yes , i did . i heard that they took both drivers to hospital . one needed surgery .
what are you going to play ?
i would like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . i have asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . i hope you will like them .
i would like to cash this check , please .
all right . shall i enter all my belongings ?
well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it is true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .
ok ... so it will come out of my account ? well , that makes it much easier .
ah , you are just too emotional .
maybe if i sold my car now , i would not be so tempted to use it .
let me see , i would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours .
but the semester just started ? why the rush ?
that is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment .
thank you and bye-bye !
will i be finished then ?
i will give you a call around 6: 00 and stop by around 6: 30 .
that is why many people look up to him .
that is usual nowadays . you have added a few shelves too .
how might you spend the weekend .
i could do some typing for you .
no . is there any direct flight to new york ?
i wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it .
oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs !
did your bid win ?
sounds like a good idea .
only about fifteen minutes .
i do not think so . that way it would lose all the charm . i want it to be a surprise . i want to show her that i care about her and i hope our friendship will last .
i want one pound of ground beef .
you are right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i almost forget it . thank you !
i think they do , but i am biased . they have a good manager and a great coach .
yes , i would call three of my former classmates really close friends . we often get together and talk with each other . whenever i counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand .
yes , we did . fortunately we put his teddy bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms .
oh , it is beautiful .
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
but swimming in the winter is good for your body . believe me .
not until next week , i think , the 15th .
that works for me !
i learned in college .
no , my picture was not taken .
yes , ma'am . no magazines during the office hours . i am sorry .
i know what you mean . i fit into my clothes , but i am not always comfortable .
well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ?
what is the matter , sir ?
it appears that you have late fees .
i am happy to be of assistance .
many thanks for your presence .
i never eat breakfast though .
it is already 10: 25 .
i never thought about it that way .
well , that is great .
oh , that is great ! thank you .
this is the first floor . the second floor is one level up .
alright . what if i cannot get a hold of them by phone ?
you are a liar !
it is a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
it is room 302 on the third floor . but i will be waiting for you in the lobby , if you cannot find me , please page me .
concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to bank of hong kong , or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies .
i did not say i was going to deprive myself .
that is a great idea . show me the barbie dolls .
what are you so ticked off about ?
yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool .
it is rather more than i was thinking of paying .
i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today .
do not mention it .
um ... it is wonderful to be here . uh ... this place looks really cozy .
it is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation .
the total will be $ 32 . 42 . will that be cash ?
we have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
they are all pretty easy-going . it is a very friendly place to work .
your parents would be happy if they knew that . because you are always a naughty boy .
good morning , pete .
i am working on it . really !
oh , dear ! i will do whatever i can .
yes . she lives on the next block .
about four days ago .
please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
i might . vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
here is the hotel .
that is our one major success . if you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase .
ok . i guess we would be not do that , either , then . what do you want to do ?
could you tell me what room had the leak ?
it is not easy to find . anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try .
let is see ... my id card , my passport , and my suitcase . i am pretty sure i have got everything .
i think so . one minute i feel quite awake , and the next i feel very tired .
ok . goodbye .
it all sounds exquisite ! i cannot wait !
it is ? oh , that is nice .
fish with noodles , please .
well , it is cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed .
ok . i will mention how great you were about helping me today . i appreciate your help .
have you ever experiences a flood ?
i cannot figure out how to turn them on .
yeah , she is great . i also admire her for her concern about society .
all of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help .
ok . but which size should i use ?
it is a new film , ' transformer ' .
could i do that right now , please ?
thanks . you are in room 507 , a big , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . is that okay , sir ?
what is your job ?
yes , i think so . the security door is so firm that nobody can break in .
you deserve credit , too . i have learned so much from you .
no , thanks . i would like to go straight home . i am very tired .
cheer up , i hope you will feel better soon .
i have done that . the doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking .
no . i would just like a refund .
much better , thanks .
so , we would like to see some embroidery .
i hope that you remembered to send in your last continued claim form .
sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you are lucky you did not get killed . and i am lucky to be alive too .
you should have a try .
did not you say you knew where to get off the bus ?
i am being attacked by hordes of cockroaches !
after you have chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? just use a very small amount of oil . fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .
the second week of september is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . the high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper .
i do not know . i feel like going out .
there is not such a code ?
yes . my name is mark benson . i just started a couple weeks ago .
why do you think there was a break-in ?
oh , it is really a drag .
what happened to him then ?
how do you know that ? you have not got in yet .
that is how much this t . v costs .
it is a pleasure .
i am sorry , i must have been confused . i had thought it is c section , but actually it is d section . i will move my car right away .
looks like you will have to get a place in the suburbs .
that is right .
what a pity ! i should have come earlier .
yes , we have . the city is famous for its beautiful evening scenery .
easy , i can do that with my eyes closed . done .
what building is it in ?
could you keep my valuables ?
why ? what is wrong ?
well , maybe not 100 percent . i did hear about some tricks people use .
your passport , please .
oh , lots of them . for instance , war risks , tend and sicc .
wen ! that is only a stereotype . like all asians are supposed to be math geniuses . i am not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus .
i went to a boxing match in the sports stadium .
no , i am not . i try and try and i still cannot speak it very well .
we should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs .
that will be fine .
how about this one ?
thanks a lot .
no . thanks for reminding me .
i hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . there is nothing left . i am so sorry ...
it is common sense that african athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon .
fine . thank you .
oh , i will have a try .
so there is something wrong with her ! it was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !
can you direct the place for me ?
how many tickets do you want ?
what date and time will you be checking in ?
really ? i thought you hated shopping ?
the gramercy tavern is highly rated . it has great food and live jazz , but it is not cheap .
yes , of course . and what is your plan ?
but that is not the only thing ... you know , he really does not have the best work ethic , i am constantly catching him on msn and facebook when he should be talking to clients .
have you got a clear idea about our company ?
would you like anything to drink ?
thank you , have a seat . we are working on the new project
i really do not know .
this is brown speaking . i would like to speak to mr . tomas .
that is a good idea . i will look into finding something like that .
yes , we have several rooms available . would you like two twin beds or one queen size bed ?
the author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . he was born in 1911 and died in 1985 .
according to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in america .
it is coming along well , but it is a little delayed .
i thought they let you go .
i am just asking . it is not like i would actually make a bid .
grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong .
okay , finally i understand . you would like souvenirs !
i have plenty of gas .

i will . thank you for all .

what flavor would you like ?
that is high .
you certainly drive a hard bargain , mrs . brown .
i have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . but i have no idea about chinese cocktails .
yes , doctor william said that he could come back to work asap .
i would like to get some details about a personal housing loan , please .
all right . i accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton fob stowed . the other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . now will you draft the agreement or shall i ?
no , not really run them . but i could help organize them . i could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . i could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . this way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
to me english is a difficult language .
where are you going to school ?
a pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking .
i just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires .
i am from california .
i know , but ... hey , jim is here ! i have been waiting to hear him sing all night .
you only care about your work .
i am making a deposit today .

all right . is your companion leaving for shanghai with you ?
what kind of salad do you want to make ?
i am still shocked that obama was elected .
well , thanks a lot for your help .
i know . i will do it .
it is harmful not only for yourself but for others .
i see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch .
yes , that is right .
do you need anything else ?
ok , i will come down tonight . thanks .
have you any package tour to italy ?
thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it does not matter , i am ready for you .
yes , is there a coffee machine around here ?
well , i really like being with her .
your meal will be delivered as soon as it is all ready . enjoy !

how much must i pay ?
well , we do not have a printer in the lobby yet . you will have to use the lab .
how much is the charge ?
what kind of live bait are you using ? worms or minnows ?
yes . that is true . we are always busy . the company attaches great importance to high efficiency . sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . and we have extra pay for extra work .
what about the trip ? do you enjoy yourself ?
what a shame .
no problem ! all those deductions do add up , and nobody is net pay is as high as they would like . i can understand why you would want some explanation .
they are in aisle 5 .
i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ?
forget it ! we seemingly need to gather money little by little .
i think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
yes , i am a singer .
are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ?
i prefer the british paper , but i will read whatever one you are not going to read right away .
you should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . after you pass both tests , you will get your licence .

i will call you later . bye .
i shave every workday , but i only shave at weekends if i am going out somewhere . if i am staying at home , i do not shave .
fortunately , things are changing these years .
and how many accounts would i handle ?
i would like to buy 1 000 shares of duson .
nothing , thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
where are you going to live after you are married ?
several things , for example , very coins , stamps , stones and so on .

well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar is . it is best suited for finger picking . a steel-string is best for playing chords .
i want to file a complaint .
as long as i do not have to row .
have they set a date for the wedding ?
thank you very much .
the dog is in the garden , too . it is running across the grass . it is running after a cat .
thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?
that is why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes .
it is for fun . and also , the apples here are green food .
i am afraid shipment by early may would be too late for us . our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . the fertilizers must be delivered before april , or else we cannot be in time for the spring sowing .
i was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
yes , it is . but we will be making a decision on it pretty soon . why do not you come in and fill out an application ?
i have checked the weather report . it says it will be cloudy , but no rain .
okay , i will take it .
how long did it take you to get your driver is license ?
well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . maybe once you get to know them , they will turn out to be more sensitive .
great ! oh , one more thing , do not forget to check the weather before we go . i would hate to get caught in the rain .
i cannot agree more .
it may take many years for the trees to grow . i hope people will stop cutting down trees .
thanks a lot .

you do realize that it is not humanly possible for us to finish by next week ?
no , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day .
yes . did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? the job does not stop when we graduate .
i hear you have to wear uniforms at private school .
may i take your order ?
which one is best ?
i will take one . and here is a dollar .
of course i know .
yeah . what is the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
it starts getting more crowded the closer you get to la .
it is made of genuine ivory , besides , it is of exquisite workmanship . the price is marked 200 yuan .
thank you for your understanding , mr . tim .
drama . i was an actor for five years after college .
i do not remember .

how much do you like to exchange ?
sure . i will give you mine too . then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason .
how about the one on baker street ?
i think i am going to eat a piece of fruit .
hello , lina . i am calling about your new pin scheme . i am new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ...
have you injured your tooth in any way ?
i do not mind paying high rent to live in new york .

i am glad you like it .
may i take your size ?
they are our products . please come in and have a look . this is the catalogue for our products .
they said he was an honest and professional businessman . but that is the exciting part . it is kind of like gambling ...

of course . there is a carrefour near the neighborhood . i will show you there if you want to .
it is cool .
that sounds good .
when will you lecture begin ?
no , i did not . what else should i keep in mind ?
i know exactly what you mean . hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling .
here is the money . could you deliver this to my house ?
excellent . i would be happy to get started on it .
what did you do ?
what ? why ? i mean ... just like that ? i am fired ?
have you tried this one ? it is very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
of course , i will .
on the contrary , mr . london , we value your friendship more than anything else . we both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . and with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . i am sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty .
why , of course . here are some that will show you our latest development . you may select which ever you need .
mendy ? are you sure ? i love her songs !
really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings , because i have never noticed anything strange when i have been at your house in the daytime .
well , mr . parsons , i am flexible when it comes to salary . the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me .
1,000 rib , it should all be there .
maybe we should get a shopping cart .
come on . just do not move .
good for you ! it sounds like you have done a lot of planning in a very short time .
i feel like maybe i am coming down with the flu .
haha . wish you good luck .
i am surprised you know so much about it . where is your phone ?
yes . we have all kinds of colors for it .
she made another white crack about my clothes .
o . k. do you have your receipt ?
thank you . oh , can i have another drink ?
hello , there , my name is tonia .
there is a three-day package tour . you will have 3 full days in the cities . it is a general tour of the cities . the itinerary includes the places of interest such as window of the world , china folk culture village . chen clan academy , southern yue tomb , and gongbei market .
hey , i am feeling much better already .
shone . and one of my friends ' name is jessie .
excuse me while i go and get that .
it is not that . there is an animal in my soup .
a secret weapon . they would better set up the defense now .
well first you have to have more confidence . employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .
you should study before you take it .
yes , i have .
certainly . have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? we have a selection of materials over here .
i have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .
how about this one ? it smells like green tea and is our best seller . try it .
i apologize for forgetting myself , but i do need some time off .
that is alright .
does this suit come in other color ?
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
bill ! sure , come on in . what can i do for you ?
all right , then . but do not forget to bring a doctors note tomorrow .
yes , i will be managing the guys on the dock .
what is the room rate ? it is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ?

if you give us your inquiry , i shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .
what is it ?
yes . you look very smart today .
yeah , his attitude is great , but he is really unreliable . sometimes he is really productive , but then other times ... take last tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting !
just fill out this form , will you ?
yes , we agreed to that . we have great confidence in your inspection institution . through years of dealing with you , we have convinced of your commercial integrity .
i traveled the three gorges .
no , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot !
we will visit the statue of liberty as scheduled .
one last thing , i have decided to come out of the closet .
that is a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and as well you will not expect your body to work without food .
yes , he does . he often has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
that is the down side of an office romance . i hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . the boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case .
remember that you are in college now , not high school .
our team was victorious .
well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
that will be sent on to you within 2 working days . then , you can start using your new card .
if next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
the doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot .
i love this wine ! it goes very well with the chicken .
which days are these classes on ?
why did not my alarm go off today ?
she feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . come on , let is indulge her .
excellent . how about the microphone and speaker ?
what section did you work in ?
thanks , you too , how see your maxes sometime .
why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop a clock .
so you must consider dearly before you go to work .
i like the way carl runs . he looks more graceful .
yes . i bought this sheet here yesterday .
no , i do not . i am too afraid of making mistakes in english . i do not want to be laughed at .
i would like porcelain .
sometimes if you do not think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
it is 150 dollars each .
no , not at all . i was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning .
just plain water with plenty of ice rock .
how long do you usually stay at university ?
you are kidding . it cannot be true .
yes , i do . it is 109 locks ave , l8v 4n9 .
i have no idea . i would like to listen to your suggestion .
yes , i am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends .
congratulations to you .
i think so . have you got all that ?
what do you think ? how does it taste ?
you must have enjoyed yourself .
we will give you your money back as long as the stereo is returned in the original packaging and with a receipt .
certainly , sir .
hello ! do you have any rooms available tomorrow night ?
that is great , i will take this two , how much is that ?

well , for one thing , she is gorgeous . she is so upbeat and sweet . who does not like her ? oh , i do not know . all i do know is that i think we have great chemistry together . but , what if i am wrong . maybe she is just been nice to me out of courtesy and does not think of me that way . oh ... forget it . this was a bad idea .
not at all ! she is really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . that is the trade . she only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . she was lying ! then i inquired , ' may i have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head .
i was doing quite well at college . i completed my mba degree in international trade with first-class honors .
yes , but i want to go to the country .
she is so pretty sick .
i would love to , but i am broke . maybe after payday .

you mean there is really not that much of a difference .
yes , i have it .
not much . i am still living at home and commuting to school . i ended up dropping that metalworking class i was so excited about . it just was not as interesting as i would hoped . the guidance counselor suggested that i focus on my prerequisite courses so that i can make sure the credits count .
i have brought with me some of old ones .
this show is like a black friends .
no , kid . this is the gynecology department .
like what , for instance ?

yes , that would work out better .
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen is boutique . i did not know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .

fine , and you ?
i am glad to see you , too . how ' ve you been ?
about nine-thirty in the morning .
ms . : let me give you a hall pass for it .
can you tell me what night you will be coming ?
i am a realist .
i usually go to the supermarket , near the station .
yes , most of the time . but , sometimes things can get difficult .
oh , how wonderful ! every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys .
i am ready ! whoa , what a hard throw ! i cannot get that !
really ? that is a lot of money to pay for one room .
well , as i have said , if your order is large enough , we are ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
c u here , honey .
it really is not hard , sir . you just have to follow the instructions .
thanks a lot . it is very kind of you .
why do you think you are the right candidate for this position ?
no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is .
oh . graham . i love you so much and i really believe in our love .
while the curtains are being made , i can start having people look at the kitchen . i cannot stand that old kitchen . i will not be able to cook there . i do not want to use that electric stove .
you can try a low-impact workout schedule . why do not you go to a gym ?
did you go diving while you were there ?
no , pls post the bill to 124 hildrod lane , milton county , 98830 .
ok , i will phone the customer right away . do you want to pick him up at our office ?
then i would like to suggest you try anchor inn on seaside drive .
of course , sir . we will press all the clothes when they are cleaned .
then what is your opinion ?
ha ha i will keep that in mind , but do not tell my husband .
i like this t-shirt . would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
that is all right . let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it is so creative to make a picture display here . how did you get that idea ?
here ? and here ?
just throw them away !
that would be nice . how are you getting there ?
good . so i will take three series and five bamboo ones .
thanks a lot . that is the favor i was going to ask you for .
glad to meet you , too .
how much do i owe you ?
i am looking for a t-shirt .
not bad . li hong , i am sorry that i cannot go to see mrs . brown with you tomorrow morning . my mother is ill . i must take care of her .
that would be great . thanks ! what time should i come over ?
i am going to paint it pink .
great , is it a two bedroom house ?
i heard he is very clear about his likes and dislikes and he is not the type to just let things go , so do not provoke him .
i do not know what his problem is .
when ? i saw him well last month .
thank you , sir . sorry to trouble you .
how many potatoes do you need ?
well , mark smith , who was the first president , founded the company in ottawa in 1955 . it has 1 . 5 billion dollars in capital . it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in canada .
the cover came off .
oh , i am so sorry .
is there anything else ?
ok . any time on friday will be ok with me .
couldn would you choose to be transferred to a real person ?
that sounds all right to us .
let is go then .
that is the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
because i want to study english literature . but i think chemistry is better for getting a job .
wow , this is sinking a hole .
you will need to apply for one .
they are only $ 20 a dozen .
i like lamb , but my husband does not .
i will remember .
there ! point out the direction . you can see a window there .
yeah . i heard a lot about it . is it really that fun ?
sure . we have a one-day trip along the river . it is quite beautiful .
do not worry , i will drive you .
i will , good luck .
how is your assistant manager getting on ?
there are another six stops .
we are on the high way . find the pound shade ..
i know , but i listened .
i promise . we are only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we have not had time for .
do you want to ensure the contents , miss ?
i have not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ?
such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich .
i am so sorry .
well , how do i put this ? france is a terrible team .
after you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor .
ok , then see you in sunday morning .
oh , i have heard a lot about the chinese herbal medicine . i believe it will work .
we shall open an irrevocable l c to cover our shipment from shanghai to hamburg . is it at sight or after sight ?
well , i have a lot of experience in this area . i have all the qualifications you need . i enjoy working with people . in my current job , i am in charge of a team of eight people .
good . let me give you my credit card number to reserve a room .
yep . the steaks and chicken are marinated and i also bought hamburger buns .
how are you going to get there ?
sure , i am heading out myself . enjoy your evening .
should i call the police ?
really . the special effects are fantastic . you should not be scared . you would really enjoy it .
thanks . please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . i would like hair spray , please .
i hope you can try to get them to step up production .
do you have a library card ?
can i apply for it right now ?
it is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . how about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ?
is that so ? well , what kind of bait are you using ?
here you are , officer .
what is so fun about them ?
what do you do , susan ?
what is wrong with it ?
thank you very much . take the pills .
regular , please .
what did that involve ?
that is ok . we have photo taking service here . you may pay your fee , take a photo there and take it back here .
thank you , sir . i would like to say that i have really enjoyed working with you . however , i think it is about time for me to leave .
there are many ancient pine trees there . it is especially quiet at night . it is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees .
sure , can i see your student id ?
i am getting dressed , what does it look like ?
i would love to .
a lot , like the party i am having on friday .
um , sure . what are we having for dinner ? do i need to put out anything in particular ?
that is fine . thanks . enjoy your trip .
cool ! that is a great idea . what did you have in mind ?
i cannot believe this for it is been 20 years since we got married .
well , why not dine out together and go to the moves .
when did this happen ?
wonderful . then how many employers have you worked for ?
what is the problem ?
my feeling is exactly .
ok then , let is get the chicken feet .
did the police find who did it ?
that is sulphur you can smell . the whole of taiwan is a volcanic region . that is why taiwan has so many hot springs . it is volcanic activity . the sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there .
well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . i think you would be the perfect person for the job !
it should not be a problem .
of course even people who do not know anything about golf know his name .
talk to you later .
but i think he cannot hold a candle to you . i do not think he has ever popped the question .
it is made of cotton .
it was the first time . you should not be so particular .
the chicken breasts are $ 4 . 05 a pound .
you are always so naughty .
flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . in my last position , i supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . there were days when i had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . i would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so i did not drop the ball . at the same time , i made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . i think communication is probably the next key quality . it really worked well when i talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
i was only interested in the haunted house and the roller coaster rides . the other rides are for kids .
round trip , please .
but how guilty to waste food !
god knows . speaking of chores , i would rather do some washing than cooking .
alright . have a nice trip .
well , i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
oh , that is ridiculous .
then he become angry with you ?
no , just a small one . next let is sing ' happy birthday ' to mary .
would you like a drink ?
it is a private garden .
what is wrong with you ?
what about that one over there ?
you were not going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? well , my creole ancestors never ate that stuff . we have refined french tastes .
did not i ?
what vegetables come with the steaks ?
yes , it is really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow .
well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . we believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . there fore , we always put quality as the first consideration .
want a ride to the office ?
here is my credit card .
that is true . but i have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners .
wait a minute . i made a phone call , but i never made a connection .
does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english speaking world ?
only if you pay your fine .
how awful ! was he hurt ?
it was around one thirty in the morning . i guess i did not fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . i just could not stop thinking about them .
i would also like to check out these books .
is not there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ?
thank you very much . by the way , where are the vegetables ?
i am definitely taking them to court .
also , mr . johnson , i would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction .
why do not you go ?
i will take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
when did you learn to dance ?
there will be a refund when i return the card , right ?
have you ever had a job before ?
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he is so into learning about different cultures .
what is his suggestion for this work ?
i am very sorry , but i must go .
what kind of keys ?
yeah , i love red apples .
oh okay , thank you .
tom and bill smith . they are both working now you know ? and they have bought a new house .
i really felt that the service was exceptionally good .
then how much is that by airmail ?
i do not have to pay for anything ?
that is my business , not yours .
to this place , please .
yes . but he does not care . i really would not want to move , but i simply cannot stand him .
i am afraid i cannot . i have a dinner party at seven tonight . you see , i am going to england the day after tomorrow .
oh , i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
i am frigid i cannot be there on time .
of course . it is a newly-built one .
follow me , please .
yes , it does . just like a needle prick . besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too .
certainly , hold on .
no , i listened to the music , too .
it should have been , but it was not .
oh , i am so happy . i will try my best to love you and protect you . i promise .
yes , i thinks so . how much is it ?
i found it in today is apartment ads .
i thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . it was a misunderstanding . she was literally screaming on the phone over this .
that is true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .
ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return .
they are okay , i guess .
this is nicola grey , and this is claire taylor .
you will get used to it . after everything stabilizes , you can regain your health .
can i pay by credit card ?
i did not do that well either . i ended up with a 3 . 2 this semester . that drops my total gpa to 3 . 45 .
no i have not . i have not visited the bund either . i have always had too much work to do .
knock on wood . but i have a very important date .
so he will make a perfect husband . make sure you will be here next monday .
yes , i have found a wonderful property i wish to buy . unfortunately , i just do not have access to the cash .
wait for a moment , please . let me check whether the private room is available or not . no problem .
not really . i do not think pop music has much depth .
i have got to commend you you really did a good job .
yes , i saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters .
oh , why is that ?
i see . let me show you some samples of various qualities . this one is very nice . it is three hundred and fifty dollars .
does a warranty come with this music box ?
yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like
how long will you be staying in the uk ?
you tried to seduce me . i fell for you .
me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they do not even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party .
that is a long way to go . it is so kind of you to help me . thank you very much .
that does not sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs , then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs .
what is the creditor is equity ?
that is right . can i get it back in the afternoon ? i really need them tonight .

please trust me . i will finish it very well .
i beg your pardon ?

stop talking about her . she gives me goose bumps . i never wish to be in her sight .
easy . it is on me .

i know , it does sound pretty awesome .
no way , mom . i do not like piano .

good morning . would you like to tell me something about the computer ? i have never seen this brand before . what is your superior brand ?
that is susan .

meat , i think .
but i have my own car and my own house .
i have been here for 3 years , and i have not had a raise in all that time . if you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and i feel it is not .
well , the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name and contact information are across the top .

i wanted some chips at lunch today , so i spent it .

we do not have much snow in winter in beijing . in fact , we have not had any so far this winter . the winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . the temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero centigrade .
it is a great game . there are a lot of new characters .

i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she is so busy these days that it is just impossible to hang out with her .
of course . i made apple pie this morning , so it is lovely and fresh .

the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .

i think you need to separate the dream of having a phd from the reality of years of more schooling . it is not as romantic as you might think .
state your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details .
well , i prefer to go on the train , but i suppose you want me to take the car .
i thought that he was with malia .

please follow my instructions . use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . now go get the wet towel .
that was quick ! i did not expect it to come through so quickly . yes , that is good news . the full amount should be 20,000 euros , is that right ? i would like to withdraw 5,000 euros worth of local currency , if that is possible .
then i would like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
if you are in school , you can get a student pass .
i am actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter .
yeah . i totally forgot they were due .
yeah , why not ? i have got a little free time on my hands . where do you want to eat ?
no , i did not , but that could be a good thing .

it is hard to say . language is not like other studies .
all right . could i have it gift-wrapped , please ?
how much do you want to spend ?
yes . the school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
that is right . after their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or english . they are very serious about learning over there .
really ? i am in a hurry . all right .
there is a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
i would like to , but i am tied up with my paper .
but i am not sure if they are well-rcceived .
i understand , officer . i guess it is just not my day today . i will accept the fine .
no , he is from australia . before i met him , i thought australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . i had no idea he would be so fussy about things .
just a moment , i will look up the rate for air-mail letters to south america .
i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
yes , he is . of course he makes mistakes , but who does not .
that is great . we will also need details of your occupation .
the award letter will inform you as to how much you will receive .

exactly what did he do ?
i need to make some copies .

once a year .
yeah , sure , you did not come to class that day ?
are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
how about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
that is 626-555-1739 . thank you so much for choosing our hotel , sir !
that is excellent . well , for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years .

do you want me to put in a good word for you ?
i feel they all talk and behave in a different way .

what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ?
let me see . the one goes for $ 17 .
let me feel your forehead . i am so glad it was not strep throat .
yes ! the first time i saw her i knew we would fall in love .
take a guess .
let me look at the calendar . good ! the twenty-fourth is a saturday . is he coming alone ?
uh ... how well do you play ?
closed ? the clerk told me i could come back and register any time during the first week of classes .
yes , but that does not make them right , does it ? just because they think so ?
that is right .
yes , i am . that is why i make plans before i do anything .
i wish you a pleasant stay here .
here you are , sir . bourbon with iced water .
i think you should put an advertisement in the china daily , saying when and where you lost it .
yeah , like it very much . my name has become a part of me .
in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day is work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect .
here is the money .
yes . how about donating some money ?
but i have gotta have the budge before anything else .
hum .. can you recommend me one with high interest ?
here it is .
great . we can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that .
yeah , but i am not there for fun . i have to remain professional and if i get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .
i said it is 5: 10 pm .
i just transferred from another school .
well , you see . i do not like the office . i do not like the staff . and i am afraid you and i do not get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
do not mention it .
fine , only a little tired .
no problem . i am really looking forward to the coming week .
yes , please . i would like to make a reservation from hong kong to tampa with a stopover in houston .
this one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter emily standing next to my wife .
has anything hit you in the head lately ?
yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .
what a great idea ! now you have a friendly audience to practice with !
compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . and anyway , i believe if you live a low stress life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . it is all in the mind .
i am afraid that cannot be done . we have never done business on such terms .
hell , i do not care . just do not submit a report to your insurancecompany .
please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
we will eat here .
i mean her personality .
i ... i ... i miss my parents , also they miss me .
we spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . we do not sacrifice quality for quick profits .
i did not know that .
you do not know that i have been over-protected by my mother these years . i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings .
irrevocable letter of credit , of course . it is the normal terms of payment in international business .
how about $ 900 a month ?
used to . but now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . but kobe is the upcoming superstar now .
it is fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
yes , my father runs a business so i have opportunity to work in the finance department every holiday .
thank you very much , doctor .
i am assuming that the dress is casual .
yes . it is so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills .
yes . i am thou ping .
and what date will you be returning ?
that is fine . thanks for coming to see us . i hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week .
which flight do you want to change ?
will the train be very crowded ?
you are not going to cook ?
yes , we do . they are on the wall behind you .
that is too late . you see , november is the season for this commodity in our market , and our customs formalities are rather complicated .
oh , yes . it is on wednesday morning . sorry about that .
i see , may i ask what the occasion is ?
i am quite alive and energetic . i am a curious person , and i like to learn new things .
i do not have money for a transfer .
sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated .
yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end .
well , since we are getting up so late , i decided to make a big breakfast !
that cup is for a urine sample .
thank you . i have got quite clear idea of it .
very nice . thank you .
how do you think the education you have received will contribute to your work in this company ?
and you think i fit the qualifications ?
goodbye . thanks again for everything .
is there any produce on sale ?
are we going to come back here for lunch ?
sure . i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
i know , but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field .
well , sir . may i have your room number ?
ok , i am sorry for that . we will arrange another one for you .
there , how is that ?
i would like to leave this bag with you .
it is one day more or one day less from tokyo to london ?
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
i am very busy these days . it seems i can never finish my work .
there are hundreds and hundreds . english is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions .
oh , i am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . especially the nightlife .
okay ... what makes you say that ? i thought you were pleased with his overall performance . did not you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ?
it is nice to see you again . have you changed jobs ?
nigel , you sure lead a dog is life , what is up with that ?
why did you do that ?
yes . is it ok with you ?
of course , but i will have to go now .
the train are not usually full . we can get them on the day we travel . we should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles .
what came up ?
oh , then what would happen if there were pests ?
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
what does she look like ?
mom , there is not any hot water
what happened , peter ? did you have a fight ?
oh , i am so sorry , sir . i will see what i can do about that .
what is the rate for a double room for one night ?
good . a wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . with competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive .
yes , he was . i imagine he must be very angry with himself for that .
new york times is better ?
think of the big face down the eve , hmm .
ah ? really ? that stinks !
in fact , they will stretch a bit later .
yes , i do . i do not like it very much .
sorry , i think you have the wrong number .
no , there is no double six at the end of the number . it is just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight .
i just have some cereal each morning .
you can renew the books over the computer .
would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?
i am just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet .
i do not know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
the export business section .
ok , ok . on one condition .
good . anything else ? the tie pins ? the cuff links ?
i am sure the output of your production will increase a lot .
i am not sure .
how much do i need to pay ?
yes , and i check all the e-mails for mr . thomas .
is that all ?
i usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . i try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
my son likes going to the main post office . they have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection .
then what is the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ?
do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?
thank you . i will .
this is linda .
save it , vince . after i put my first million in the bank , i will say you are welcome .
of course . the website is ' www . zhilian - zhaopin . com . cn ' .
it is hard to tell . maybe it is because you are not resourceful enough to be a manager .
in about 2 hours .
if they wanted to say something about my call last week , why did not they sand it to me ?
i remember now . i met him before .
yes , my friend and i just had breakfast at the dining room , but we did not use any services .
that quilt was passed down to me from my ma in holland .
really ? that is the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
i did it myself . i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed . i am sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . i learnt a lot by doing it myself .
how large a group are you expecting ?
i had a wonderful time .
where are you going to study ?
thank you , ma'am . would you like to use it until may 20th ?
of course . this balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner is equity . so , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner is equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . that means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor is and the owner is equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 .
yeah . i have one from college at my parents ' house .
well , i guess we would better grab our umbrellas then , as well .
yes , i would like to have a roast chicken leg .
are you upset ?
i only had nine little problems here . other than that , i enjoyed my stay , and i loved the city .
i would like to have it done this friday .
i know , but i am really hot .
not surprising . i bet she is very tall and slim .
surely it is a sound idea , mr . joey . but i have a few questions for you first .
i see . what is that ratio exactly ?
what ? what does that mean ? why will not there be any results ?
my co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon ... our ceo .
yes , it is half price . it is supposed to be too large-that is the fashion .
it varies from time to time . at present it is 6 .
i see . that sounds fine . until what time are you open ?
how about you hair style ?
no one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . maybe i should learn to do something .
hello , marry , this is lin wang , calling from network .
i am sorry . i cannot hear your very clearly . could you say that again , please ?
do you want anything to make you feel better ?
i am sorry , i did not know that . but i wanna help .
we do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like spring festival and the mid-autumn day .
well , how did you like the show ?
is it far ?
yes . one more is needed .
yes , i am the guy .
30 dollars and 10 cents ? here you go .
that is all right .
i know what you mean . i cannot stand computer geeks .
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
yes . sit down , please . how did you learn about our company ?
i really do not know . i do not think we will win many gold medals , but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
it is on the arm rest .
do you know what kind of salad that you want ?
and what will you do if you do not have enough cash ?
well , i am doing okay . and how about yourself ?
i do not want to miss my flight .
i am sorry to have taken up too much of your time .
funny . oh , i like this song . it is by one of my favorite singers .
come on ! what are you nervous about ?
i would like to see as many as possible .
could you please tell me your passport number ?
you got it .
what is your problem then ?
how sweet ... if you make me some more toast , i will let you use my new retro toaster ...
yes , please do .
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office does not help .
how about this one ?
yes , look over there . that is the empire state building . my book says it is 102 stories tall .
i am sure we do have .
i appreciate your help .
she is your sister . what she asked was only duck soup for you . why cannot you be good to her ?
when is it convenient for you ?
i am still feeling a little sick .
i have not got two minutes at the moment . cannot you go over things without me ?
very big and exciting , but very crowded , too .
yes , i would . i need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , i love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
i suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . it is a great starting point for discussion
he is the love of my life ! i have really messed this up .
that is good . and here i give you a piece of advice . you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . besides , it is better to secure the cartons with metal straps . what is more , the order number was not anywhere on some of the boxes .
well , my first order of business will be attending a conference in seattle , but after that i intend to spend two weeks visiting my friends . i assumed a business visa would be required .
do not ask such a question . you know it has no certain answer . everyone knows it is in his heart .
the regular price is $ 2980 . 00 , but until december the 31st it s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 .
why ? what is wrong ?
good news for us . when can you start to work ?
you are like the tenth person to say that .
what is that ?
well , it depends on the journey . it is .. i guess it is not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound .
that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant .
you think so ?
where are you going ?
you could use your wireless right here in our lobby .
i thought he usually wrote horror books .
and we are going to have summer vacation .
oh , it is lovely . think of the nasty weather we had last week .
i am studying languages . this year i am doing german and italian .
is that your new bicycle ?
what about the cotton one ?
we will pump air into this cuff to get a reading .
yes , i do .
form your company is advertisement in the twenty-first century , i learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . i am interested in it . here is my resume , ma'am .
i also want to pack up my package . this is the notes .
why ? this is a fair market price .
it is bigger than our last one . i have got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .
no , you do not have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
what did the critic say ?
thanks . room 507 is a spacious , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . does that meet your expectations ?
i know , and that is why i am always respectful and i keep my distance . it is safer that way .
yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time .
that is exactly how i feel .
smoking or non-smoking ?
well , i am really surprised . you are not doing anything behind my back , are you ?
i am sorry to hear that .
yes , i do . we are doing pretty well this season . we have won most of our games , but we are not top of the league table .
of course mike . who else ? we fell in love at first sight .
here you are .
i guess she forgot your meeting . she is attending an important meeting in the company . will you have a seat ? may i leave a memo for her ?
maybe it is right since everything is possible . you know the market changes quickly these days . but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .
it is industrial exhibition , in origin show the results of new industrial products in the city . a lot of products there to meet the needs of home and export
what are you going to do now ?
i do not see anything wrong with it .
i do not think this place is for you .
well , you always say you are busy .
no , what is it about ?
yeah . i can live with it . it is great to be living alone .
i have finished .
yes . and can you pack the things up , please ?
all right . but so help me it is a better work .
come on ! stop being so vain . you look great ! you are beautiful !
oh , right . i forgot about that . sorry , i will pay cash .
they are not cheap , but neither is their furniture .
not yet , i must water the garden first .
i will get my finals in two months .
yes , but i do not know much about it .
many things are troubling me . i do not know whether i should come and go .
right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . we are hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . in fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend .
yeah but the bus takes a long time . you could fly - it is not so expensive these days .
acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment .
oh man , i hate rejection . it really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person .
yes , it has . i am looking forward to seeing you . too . and your new house . uh ... when does the party start ?
yes , i can , but not very well .
i would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs .
well , thin is always in with the media .
you are right . the view is spectacular . but that bedroom is so small . we would never be able to fit all of our stuff in there .
when do you plan to travel ?
easy . view the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting .
thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
well , there is a department store on grant street . there are restrooms in the basement .
a quarter past five .
to sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
glad to meet you , mrs . tina .
yes , sir .
alright . maybe it is the only way to do it .
well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you .
she is been good . she is in grade one in joy chain high school . and she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 .
will the award letter tell me what i need to fill out next ?
i will give you two clues . first , it cost more than $ 250 . and second , it is not big , but fat .
yes , i am glad i have come .
em , as i have said , i am diligent and industrious . on the other hand , sometimes i am too hard-working and i put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect .
try having a car wash or selling candy .
well , afternoon flight on december 10th to shanghai . may i have your name , please ?
of course ! everyday , there is a deadline to meet . bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . it is so busy . but anyway , i have trying my best to be a good employee .
are you crazy ? the papers make everybody listless . i do not think you are the exception
can you stay and accompany me for a while ?
that is my perfume .
do not mention it .
yes , i like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best . try some beef , please .
that is fantastic ! you really got me there .
they look great ! hey , are you hungry ? i know a good ethiopian restaurant-meskerem .
that sounds reasonable .
i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise .
what would you suggest to see ?
the thing i like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them .
you got me .
sorry , madam . you have to wait your turn . the parking lot is full .
do you want to watch it ?
do they charge for that ?
a company account . i need to pay a bill .
sure . i did not know you like mysteries .
not at all . we are friends .
if not , your nose will wake you up .
that is truly amazing !
i want the best one .
my current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan .
yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone .
ok , i promise we will get there in twenty minutes .
that sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ?
good . i will take that one . is there a bar in your hotel ?
the owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .
please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
oh , it is almost 9 . i need to hurry . i am running late now . see you after class in front of the library then . bye !
yes , as a representative of ibm . i hope to conclude some business with you .
well , that is good . if you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . that will save you plenty of money .
i am really sick !
have you ? that is splendid . just let me get my things together . i will not keep you long .
if i had not married an italian man , i probably would not be pregnant so often . and maybe i could raise pigs instead of bambinos !

so , what do you want to do ?
are you kidding ? it is winter . why would i open it ?
how about your oral english ?
have a good one .
that should not be a problem , mr fang . have you got your certificate of use of foreign exchange account and the foreign exchange account opening notice with you ? our most widely used currencies are us dollar , japanese yen and hong kong dollar .
you do not have any problems with how it looks ?
if you need help , do not hesitate to ask me .
and what name of reservation made under ?
no , she has not .
how about some coffee and tea as well ?
we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions .
let is stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch ..
sure . do you want to have the car washed ?
that is not a problem . i will pop in later today to make a formal request . thanks !
another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , i do not need a desktop anymore . a laptop is enough .
it does look a little strange , i did not notice that before .
you are going to have a little montezuma is revenge tomorrow morning .
you do ? how are you going to contact him ?
really ? well . ok . get the receipts out .
yes , a dish of cream of wheat .
what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?
thanks . you can also seek job information on the internet .
you are very welcome .
but what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ?
it is like this , it is square with a leather cover .
it seems that i have been given two classes scheduled at the same time .
yes . i like carmen very much . but i do not mind if you want to tell me about this one .
so maybe we should not go out after all .
oh , no ! i did a lot of bad things this year . i hope the kitchen god is not like lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody !
what kind of software can you use skillfully ?
very agreeable , mr . smith . it will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you .
i want to mail this package .
i am from textile import and export corporation . i have come to meet you . my name is zhang yong .
we still need to find an armoire and a dresser .
i am afraid you have parked on a double yellow line , sir .
wait a moment . and you can check where other sales are .
i am so proud of you .
should i accept their offer ?
sir ... sir ? are you all right ? sir ?
ok , i will meet you at the club at two thirty .
where exactly have you been working , please ?
ok , so can i say , this is abby is voicemail . i will call you later , so leave me your name and number .
ok . a reservation for eight at7 : 30 , room 208 . please do not be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests .
a big one would be nice .
wow , the cheer-section is coming . the music is so fantastic .
have a biscuit instead . eat more and smoke less !
that would have to be miss baymler , my fourth grade teacher .
yes , i am wondering if i can join the sightseeing tour in your hotel .
i would like to cash my undue large-amount deposit certificate , please .
did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?
okay , then a third one for my husband too .
my name is mona white .
sort of , but i could know more , i guess .
fine . i miss you so much , uncle benjamin .
i tell you what , 8: 00 is no good for me , but why do not you guys get started and i will come by at around 8: 45 or so .
i think i prefer face-to-face instruction better .
sounds like you are happy with your decision .
ok , shall i make a coffee first ?
at a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame .
ok . just wait where you are . i will send someone up to help you .
yes , i know how to get there on my own .
that is wonderful . i want to get a part-time job too . tell me what i should do .
what section does it have ?
basically , you just cannot drive .
not really . i like looking on the internet at what is available , but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i am buying before i pay for it . sometimes , i will look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it is cheaper . you do not like buying things online , do you ?
sure , what is it ?
which bus goes there ?
she freelanced with us for 3 years . she was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with .
a sony . it is only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart .
i have mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home .
i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ?
it is a priority seat . we can not sit there . we should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people .
we rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . it was very exciting .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that is a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
ah , i am going to the pub to watch the football .
i do not really . i just like wildlife , and you do not get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
no , i just want to meet you .
i would like to exchange 5000 singapore dollars into the us dollars please .
i would better see you there .
may i see your ticket and passport , please ?
i want to see the museums , and i want to shop a lot .
what is donna like , by the way ?
no problem , is this blue ok ?
no ! so ... is halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?
yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them , but they do not often succeed .
i guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
it is very nice . i have not heard live music in a while . this is fun .
i would rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
i enjoyed talking to you too .
she works as a teller in a bank .
yes , madam .
well , after the half of the meeting , there will be an interval for rest and refreshment .
hey , ken . good luck if you already put your money on the red sox .
i know what you mean .
i do not like it . actually i am looking slacks .
yes , i think so . i have just checked out . but i left my book in the room . can i get it back ?
ok . let is go !
that is good to hear . now there is still a whole new york day ahead of me .
so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
i would like to book a ticket to singapore , please .
when did it start ?
well , let is try a size ten . he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on . looks like a perfect fit .
sure . i am free tomorrow . it sounds interesting to me . can we buy the ticket online ?
i advise that step be taken in power supply first .
do not take too long . it would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather .
i think it is because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances do not need to last more than five or ten years at most .
can we walk there ?
interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends , too ?
oh , come on ! an excuse like that is tantamount to lying . you are essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks .
well , he uses our vcr at home . but he is going to university in the fall , so he needs his own vcr .
ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
yes . a dish of cornmeal weight .
that is rather hard .
that is my friend tim who lives nearby .
it is room number 261 .
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per-school children .
you drive a hard bargain ! ok , that is a deal .
is it near here ?
is that right ? i hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . how can you be sure your idea will cash in ?
ok . that is a deal .
what about cheese cake or apple pie ?
actually , i would forgotten about it .
no problem at all , sir . housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit .
i do not think the green one fits her complexion . do you have any skirts in light color or tan ?
pcc is perfectly fine for me .
but i still do not know which unit is in need of staff .
that is everything .
the professor is a bit boring today . you need something to perk yourself up . how about a coffee ?
i do not like folk music very much .
cancelled ! so what am i supposed to do now ?
not a problem . the number is 626-555-1739 .
so , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . where do you exercise ?
no , it is unnecessary . just respect the staff and their own opinions .
it is hard to believe that we are really leaving . the past two weeks was like a dream .
well , maybe just a little . i cannot seem to make it fit .
that is a big family . how old is your sister ?
well , i did not realize that .
well , most of my time here was pleasant . and new york itself is fantastic .
read me the index number !
there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
you will be able to add or get rid of channels another day .
i cannot forget it .
she means business , for sure .
do not , do not , do not , do not say that . that , that makes it worse .
there is nothing else ?
mmm , how much is it ?
a new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . they have a variety of candies and it is always full of people .
7: 30 p.m . performance , please .
i like the novels of inches very much , i have reading almost all of them in chinese translation , i wish i can reading them in the original .
that will do . where shall i go to pay the money ?
oh ok , where do i get off ?
fine . listen . are you free on wednesday night ? i would like to invite you to dinner .
yeah , i love that , no class , no homework , and no exams .
well , i am trying to buy some foreign currency for my holiday .
oh , that relationship is history . malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday .
i suppose this song can be the no . 1 on the top chart .
what about roses ?
ok . i understand . thank you .
no , that will be too expensive .
is the software user-friendly ?
or maybe make the beds .
no , i do not . i cannot stand them ! !
did you see his face ?
where is the interview happening ?
no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you will be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
yes . i had a bad traffic accident . look , my car looks like a squashed coke can .
anything else i can do for you , sir ?
the statue has for a century acted as a figurehead for the american dream .
i basically believe in science over theology . i mean , i believe in evolution for example . however , there are many things that science has not explained yet .
see you then .
oh , is it ?
it is my pleasure , what can i do for you ?
oh , really ? do you know which company they are from ?
oh , i see .
yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good .
here you are . i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account .
do you have training program or plan for employees ?
well , as for albert , he should go to an office supply store . there is a very good one called office depot . they have everything he will need . and their prices are good too . it is very convey
you really do a good job .
i am ok . i will be fine . i'v cool . i am cold . i am like ice . she will not know what hit her .
how much is it ?
why are you so kind to him ?
hello , i am sorry it is been such a long time . i have been away on business . i would like to discount this .
i would love to help you ! what is your budget for the dinner ?
what are you doing that for ?
i am going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
that is what i ate yesterday .
come in please .
what a lovely gift . yes , i can understand why you would not be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . i think one of our small ones will be perfect . do you have some id with you ?
well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . and the seafood is tastier !
well , when does the party start ?
sorry to hear that .
i do not know . the produce person can tell you , though .
yeah , we did get off too early .
every month i would only have to pay $ 725 .
well , let me take a look at my grade book . how do you think you are doing ?
ok , then . i love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . it is really artistic .
perfect , and i like her charming eyes too .
thank you . i will not let this promotion change me .
will you be getting another copy anytime soon ?
ok . anything else ?
i am glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ?
this is my first , i only met jane last week . she and i teach at the same school .
it is fine . i was heading there anyway .
so , ms . thou , we are a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over america .
pretty well . everyone is working hard .
the bright people will remember it forever .
do not tell me it affects our flight .
i feel very nervous about it .
i know . he is usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side .
let me have a look at the pamphlet .
exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ?
what a nuisance !
how sweet ! maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !
what time would you like your wake-up call ?
great . talk to you then .
happy to see you .
let is get the table wares we need first , and then stand in the line .
our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the america , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle .
i am so sorry that i have got to go . i have a business appointment right now .
we have invited all our sophomore friends from school .
i really like caesar salads .
do you hear something ?
you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america .
you do not have anything bad to say about her ?
it is not raining , darling . the bench is not wet .
can i have it charged to my account , please ?
what happened to this book ?
what about the chicken ?
why do you buy stocks , then ?
maybe you are right .
so what did you do ?
hello , my name is paula . nice to meet you !
what about vegetables ?
i will not be able to pay that right now .
so what do these organs do , teacher ?
i see . we offer personal housing loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0 . 42 per month .
i believe you will . i am very pleased with your work . your promotion will contribute to the development of the company .
yeah , it is really a unique experience . it is a solo concert by pavarotti . he put on the performance in the forbidden city in beijing .
i would be glad to , sir . but may i ask what line of business you are in ?
you know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods ?
of course , mr . green .
say what you want to say .
that is perfect .
what do you mean ? it is expensive !
ok , sir . we will be there right now ... sir , your table is ready .
thank you very much .
yep ! i heard that your company is registering a new trademark .
yes . but first you must observe the visiting hours , it is from 2 to 5 p.m . by the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward .
this scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks .
now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers , then slice the meat .
yeah . two-toned , white and yellow .
right . she is not very tall and she is quite plump . she is got blonder hair , but i do not know what color her eyes are .
entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
really ? where ?
this is a first ! you must have won the lottery .
i heard they were just married for 5 months .
i would have to say yes and no on that . i do not get a big end of the year bonus like i did at lemans but i get to take classes for free if i want to . i have always wanted to get a graduate degree so i am taking classes now to do that .
i will just get a regular home computer then . i do not think i will need to lug my computer around with me .
maybe . i have not been able to keep my food down either . that is unusual .
i do not know . what do you want to eat ?
first , i would like to know if you offer employees sick leave .
in what room is this pipe ?
yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip , too .
let me see if he is free . would you please sit down and wait for a moment ?
the wire in your phone might have gotten rusty . could you bring your phone into our office ? we will clean it for you .
ok , you win . you pick the restaurant this time .
mom , what should i do ?
it is aubreyinchina yahoo . com .
what is strength do you bring to the job ?
what is the meeting for ?
i have no idea , any suggestions ?
can i have your key and room number , pls ?
yes , what about us having a tour ?
i guess we should start with nominees first .
of course , we will need some documentation from you . like your resident permit , proof of salary and your usd deposit certificate , to use as collateral .
what ! for being a couple of hours late ? you have to be kidding !
what about listing my interests and affiliations next ?
oh , i see . thank you .
how much are the parking tickets ?
just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas .
what do you do on that day ?
i could also bring some music if you want . i have got loads of songs on my new ipod .
but i thought it was . anyway . i am in a hurry . here is the money .
darned right i would !
we ate everything from dinner .
ok . i will miss you . i hope we can see each other again soon .
i really do not want to know about this . physics gives me a headache .
i just voted .
sure . you just walk down this hallway . the copy room is the second room on the right .
which john ? mr . turnbow is son ?
we are on the bottom floor .
wow ! i cannot wait to change into my trunks !
to the municipal government hall .
. i have a house in the suburbs .
how about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ?
well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest china . at the moment , that area is calmer .
what is your present permanent address ?
all right , ma'am . i will check and tell them to be quiet .
i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , i cannot send out this e-mail . do you have the number of the text port ?
nice to meet you .
i am serious .
no , i usually have to stand .
i know it is not good for me , but the problem is i just cannot help it .
can you name a few examples ?
about ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
can i get you anything to drink ?
i will take your word for it .
sure have . i want to offer my parents a better life so , i will have to work very hard .
well , i would just like you to help me with the holiday schedule .
checking out time is twelve . guests will avoid an additional days room charge by checking out on time .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
excellent . have you had french food before ?
well , i believe it now , and when are they are getting married ?
no , we just do not usually admit it !
but the child has his own feeling .
yes . and i would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in nanjing .
his face broke out and he said it was my fault !
you see ? every cloud has a silver lining .
i have many hobbies . i like most all kind of sports , and i also like to listen to classic musics .
i like those kinds of programs too . they are very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
that will be $ 12 . 15 .
thank you so much .
that is right , dave . i tricked you into giving a confession . and i have recorded every word of it .
yeah , bob moved in last week . he is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i am really looking to settle down .
mi stands for middle initial .
of course not .
the beauty under the tree ?
oh , blonde , she is very blonde ... quite short hair ...
you are welcome .
yes , of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
we will first go to mount tai , then we will go to sichuan by air , after that we will be leaving for tibet .
i see . and i will always be devoted to you .
my mother is been ill and i had to stay at home .
sure , what did you want to do ?
definitely . the minutes have to be taken accurately .
gorgeous ! what should i bring on that day ?
you can decide later . you will have choices before you submit your university application form .
yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is america is favorite pastime .
you can be assured of it . there are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum .
i cannot say i agree .
i am applying for the waiter in your pub .
we have been planting trees for many years .
how hard is the climb ?
i am going to take care of this and refund your money .
i am almost hungry .
may i try it on ?
i always make time for family .
what makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
i do not have it .
make it three cups . here comes harry .
how ? by drinking ?
un ... i think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they are watching .
all right , all right . he will get them as soon as possible .
what makes you think so ?
yes , very . i thought the last speaker was especially good .
now . you can see why it is called the lantern festival .
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing , in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' fragrant mountain ' .
no , we do not do that here . we recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products .
many americans have never gone to a etv . it is not an american thing to do .
let me see . you could exercise more to keep fit .
i hope to do a little gardening . i find it very relaxing .
see you then .
well , it is hard to say . for the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , i think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year .
yes , of course .
it is not so complicated . it is about five minutes walk from here . i can draw a map for you if you wish .
no , you do not . just fill out this card and sign your name and room number on it .
yes , that is right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
i have not given it much thought . do you have any good suggestions ?
the tv news does not tell us the race anymore .
all right . gotta go , bye , keep in touch .
just get over here !
have you got the ticket ?
maybe it is just that he is stressed out from work or something . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .
with or without ice , sir ?
get me some of each .
i just like the pier they have at santa monica .
i was hoping i could find something made in the ' 20s .
we do . we will spray the apartments before you move in .
look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called wild things ? !
that is what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really do not think it is proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
so you are afraid someone is going to snipe your buddha ?
here is your bill . it totals 3250 dollars .
sorry . the road is too crowded .
i just want to visit the family some day .
yeah . look , other kids are coming this way .
i will find one myself , of course . i am a modern girl .
yes , i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
what kind do you like ?
fine today , though a bit under the weather last week .
very well . please sit down here . do you want me to cut your hair very close ?
i decided that you are right .
i have no idea yet . do you have any suggestions ?
in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman .
a minimum of 75,000 per year .
i will take the student bus pass .
i will be voting tomorrow .
i passed college english test band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . i have not got any certificate of computer skills , because i do not think certificates are necessary if what is needed is merely operating a computer . i think , to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office
and then i made lunch .
i am a stranger here . how can i get there , please ?
i am sorry i am late . i overslept . is the manager here today ?
that sounds really tasty .
but it is so old .
yes . it is on this street . keep walking for two blocks and it is on the corner on the right .
well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . but now there are some new flavors from asia like green tea and durian .
which ones are you referring to ?
there is a beautiful state park here . i can see why so many people come out here to camp .
maybe i can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together .
sure . our special wine today is a 1989 chardonnay .
yes , it is . you also have free use of the leisure facilities here .
i want to make another offer , but i am afraid that they will decline and i will lose this house .
according to the records , your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights . the room rate will be 110 dollars per night , including 10 tax and 4 service charge . is this right ?
i see . thank you .
that was mean to say .
when did it happen ?
do not worry about a thing we are just taking a second look and talking .
demographics say an average age of 28 . 7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 k a year .
that is 680 yuan .
no , i am not sure i am going to .
that is right . i can see them in my dreams .
i think you should give them some credit . they are very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
how about some burgers ?
about two years . and you ? are you based here ?
oh wow ! thanks a million , angie !
i see your appointment . what day would you like to switch to ?
no . but they play techno all the time . it drives me crazy after forty minutes . and anyhow , if we go to the latin club you could actually learn some latin dance steps . at the new bar you will just shake yourself around for an hour . and then you will get sick of stand you will want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . i know you .
mike , you are late again .
yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for as .
oh , very good .
sorry , i am looking for my wallet .
but by then , the technology will be outdated .
ok , that is probably expensive , but not that bad .
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you .
that sounds like a good idea . we can chill out a little in such a hot summer . are you good at swimming ?
there is a laundry form in your room ars well as a bag . fill out the form and put them together with the laundry in the bag . the maid will come and pick it up .
what number are you calling from , please ?
what is going to be covered in the orientation ?
i have wanted to be involved in engineering ever since i was little . and my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer .
no . i was here last semester , but i did not find out about this class in time . so i am taking it this semester .
it is on the first floor by the nurse is office .
coing out for a walk .
that will be lovely . where are you going ?
yeah , me too ! what are you thinking you would like to do ?
i have just been reading an article about them . they will be used for all sorts of things now .
so , what can i do for you today ? are you needing to withdraw or transfer ?
i will accept your offer .
it certainly is . it is so much fun .
yes . we have signed them before . we even brought our chops .
i will , thanks for your concern .
yes , it is !
i will get right on that , and i am very sorry .
thanks for coming over to help . i really appreciate it . first , could you peel the vegetables ? i have put them all in the sink and there is a peeler .
that is how it works .
that is true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there is no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i am sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there is nothing i can do about that . my boss will not believe me if i tell him the truth .
i am quite out of thoughts recently .
that looks lovely . just one more thing , you need a pair of earrings .
sorry again for bothering you .
sorry , love .
admittedly , i hope it is a job in line with my specialty . but i will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me .
ok , make a left here ... no wait , i meant make a right . come on , speed up !
oh , no , you do not .
as long as you do not overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be ok .
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
he really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . would that be ok ?
yes . thank you .
thank you , madam . have a nice drive !
oh , did you ? thanks a lot .
sounds good . what did you have in mind ?
no , i do not . i just do not know how to handle this . this is my first time , you know .
and can you tell me about the re-inspection ?
that happens often these days . well , please fill in this report of theft .
of course i remember you .
not a problem . could you tell me you l c number , please ?
maybe you are right to some extent .
it depends what it is . once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . if there is something that is not broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . but if it is not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time .
it is our pleasure .
yeah , she is hot . radiator is leaking . looks like you were running her pretty hard .
well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , dvds , and a lot of nice clothing , too .
fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . what do you think about 20 this time ?
all right . i am opening the window , though , is that ok ?
okay , i will do it next time .
well , dear , we cannot force him to go to college . it is up to him .
no . that is not why i raised my hand . i need to go to the ladies ' room .
it is not .
come on ! rest breads rust .
after i graduate , i have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . i think i have got a good chance of passing . there is a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in london , provide
what will the weather be like tomorrow ?
well , i am not everyone-else is father . i think you need be in the house by ten of the clock .
could you work for us in another state , if need be ?
dad , it makes no sense .
yes , i would like to buy this dress , please .
i was there for about three weeks .
is there anything else bothering you ?
well , i think i would like to have a tomato sausage soup first . and the same for him , please .
that is the one .
then i will just shut up and sit down !
it is pretty simple , iris . just keep it in mind that you are what you eat .
you are meeting trouble halfway , i guess .
i will certainly look into that .
fine , just fine . and you ?
blow my nose ?
that is something we can discuss later .
oh , i know . thank you . professor wang .
do you enjoy working in this office ?
great . send it to me by fedex tomorrow morning . or better , call federal express for a pick-up . that way i will get it even earlier .
do you know where we get off at ?
yes . i have been a guide for two years .
yi-jun , we are in the states . here it is all burgers , steaks , and dogs .
do not worry about money . i will treat you tonight .
come on , nancy . play it cool . i go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight .
yes , i would like to get some gas .
were not you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
wang wei . room 1212 .
nonsense ! there is no indication that he is in love with me .
thank you for saying so .
that is a good idea . after i get rid of the old clothes i no longer wear , i can see what new clothes i need to buy .
yes , it is . what can i do for you ?
nah , do not be so fast . we like your work here , but this company is on hard times . and i cannot be handing out raises for anyone .
any time is fine .
the taj ? they are a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
well , when were you planning on doing that ?
you did a fabulous job .
that is true . you know , some husbands and wives do not even live in the same city any more .
$ 308 ! that is not bad .
i do not , but i could not find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
i heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .
well , i prefer active rather than passive training . for example , i like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . they sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . all employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . we had a lot of fun learning together . it helps to build up the work relation among colleagues .
what were you mean duties there ?
yes . i will pick you up first , and then we will go get megan .
i hope it will be of some use to you .
i do not know . it looks a bit red , but i am sure it is nothing .
did you go shopping ?
that is great ! i will go there right now and speak with the boss .
whose name did you pick ?
good idea . have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
do you know which one he would like ?
yes , it is much earlier than past years .
how long has it been since we last saw each other ?
well . i was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ?
not yet . i am not finished with my research yet .
could you give me a description of your case ?
that is right . i have a lot to learn from you .
no . not that . i mean a training card . the card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine . here , let me show you .
i am not ready to get off the phone with you .
did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?
i .. i do not feel like saying it .
i hope we do not have any more blackouts .
nothing exactly . she is grown into a very attractive young lady .
what do you think determines an employee is progress in a company such as ours ?
yes . i gotta review all of them for the final exam . it is just around the corner .
first you must check in at counter no . 4 .
do you like olives ? or would you prefer crisps ?
we are identical . i mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
here you are , but i forgot my photos .
nope , lost again . but , it was a good game .
probably we can put one on that counter . and we can put one on the floor by the bed . over there .
sure , and i am glad to meet you . thanks for your help .
with the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . i think this model may be just what i am looking for .
it is going to be $ 55 .
sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . while waiting , would you like anything to drink ?
why did you say that ? it is a good thing for him to live with his son .
she is very generous with her money . i think that is because she was poor when she was young .
no . i just went cold turkey , and i never smoked again .
yes , we do , debit or credit ?
you are right , no problems . you are becoming quite the expert , mr lawson . if any problem does turn up , which i am sure it will not , i will give you a call .
great ! thank you very much .
i do not think so . but it could have been .
that is a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play pingpong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
italian . they played very well , but they were not very lucky .
when will the branch office open ?
wow ! how high-class ... a new pair for each day ...
what is the problem ?
that is fine . please call again later .
yes , that is true . still , it is hard to believe . yesterday our high was only 50 degrees fahrenheit .
i am sorry . i forgot to show it to you . here it is . it comes with the pan .
sorry , my english is not so good . could you speak a little slower ?
do you have an appointment with mr . smith ?
yeah . i am going to celebrate tonight . wanna hang out ?
can you make a description of your wallet ?
of course ! it is area code 626-555-1739 .
regardless of how much pressure you are under , there is never a good reason to take drugs .
i can try to get the book from a different library .
that is not a very good pick . i am against the yankees .
i went straight to university afterwards . what about you ?
cool ! i cannot believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
i am in the car business .
are you planning on voting ?
okay , let me make sure i got that
i already told you that i am going to do it .
yes , do not use the lifts . we have regular fire drills so you will soon become familiar with the procedure . and always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading .
let me see it .
hurry up , will you ? we will have to go to the gas station first .
you always say that , but we never win anything ! what will you do if you win a lot of money ?
they are cucumbers . they are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin . have not you heard them say on tv that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?
there is a snowman over there .
do you think though that ... that in ... in a sense television skilled people is own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they are bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
i am hoping that this test goes well for me .
i am awesome . well , i guess that is my answer , is not it .
we can do it when you have some time .
i have passed the five courses required by the chinese cpa association , but the certificate will not come to hand until next month . how about that ?
well , it depends . you see , there are eight famous chinese for instance , the sichuan cuisine , and the hunan cuisine .
when will it arrive ?
ah , i do not know a fit works . last time , all i saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me .
when will it be available ?
that is interesting . so why did you become a hairdresser ?
so you are happy that you made the decision to join us .
poor john ! he is bettering bother sides of this bread .
yes , i like working like that .
we have to wait six more minutes !
sure , what would you like to discuss ?
oh , how did you deal with it ?
yes . i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off .
i am going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
but mum , we are watching this movie .
i am happy to recommend the fish , it testes delicious , and it is today is special . our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . today special is actually his favorite dish . so i am sure it is a
for $ 100 you will have a radio , a color television , a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room every day .
no , it is not .
there is a garage sale around the corner .
of course . first you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
so it is time for the kids to get outdoors ...
the personal card , please . is it possible to take care of this over the phone ?
oh , my god . it is disaster . it makes my head look like a soccer ball .
will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
but i am afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
that is right . i drove it into a lamp post . can your mechanics repair it ?
come on , you sound like my mom . look at it , it is beautiful !
he has the flu .
oh . this is paul . when will he be back ?
it is not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it is interesting to join them .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
i understand . may i make an appointment then ?
thank you . my wife would be very happy to hear this .
why ? what happened ?
i like this style , but i do not like its color . do you have this coat in yellow ?
i do not know . but this is definitely the last straw .
i think it leaves at two-thirty .
maybe you have not found the magic .
not at all , sir . here you are .
he is hopeless .
now , is there any warranty with this ?
yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden .
well , you are really as out-dated as she is .
busy with your work again ?
really ? how do you know that ?
what are you doing ?
if i do all this do you think i can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?
post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . the queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment .
all right . let me check our technician is schedules . i will call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . what is your phone number ?
thank you ! i will be sure to return the favor after our first class , ok ?
i am afraid not . he is in jail for house-breaking at the moment .
do be patient , honey . let is do it slowly and correctly .
i have no idea .
i can help you there . those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together .
i think that is what i want . how much is it ?
yes , totally . it is nice to meet a customer who understands the system .
if they are not connected right , that will keep it from turning on .
what did he say ?
what kind of watch is it ?
alright this is a good one . what would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ?
what will happen next ?
ok , here you are .
true . ok let is go to grumose ?
i majored in economics .
really ? let me have a try .
that sounds easy enough .
i have not decided yet .
why on earth would she do that ? you mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? that is crazy !
not too good yet . better than i was though .
apple pie , please .
yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
so see you .
say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?
actually , i enjoy both .
okay , i think i understand .
it is the marketing is fault , i suppose . what do you want to do ?
what do you want to speak to me about ?
would you please fill out this registration 1 form ?
i am thinking about that idea we talked about .
he is in bed , doctor . can you see him , please ? he has a bad cold , too !
you know what ? do not mention it .
cannot you stay for a little bit longer , it is only 8 .
no . there is makeup remover for waterproof mascara .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you did not take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
a return ticket , please .
yes , i will have a steak , please .
left the next junction . ok .
what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
yes , this is the best we can do .
i go to panda express for my chinese food .
someone else is making charges on my debit card .
okay . i would like to change some euro into us dollars , please .
to hell with you .
yes , can you tell me what is my responsibility in this position ?
what about tomorrow morning at 9 ? i will come over to your hotel .
good . now , if you will just sign here , you can start work in 3 days .
because i am very interested in administration and i did take some courses in it . i also performed well in the subjects . hence i believe that i can do a good job in this position .
ok . you would better come back in two hours .
are there the records of michael jackson ?
yes , i would like a large soda , please .
i heard it .
just let me sleep 5 more minutes .
i am nineteen .
i was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color .
yes i know . i have to do it every week . anyway , are you ready to go ?
you will have to pay 20 rib , and then you will have your southern fund management company card .
no problem . we can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room .
i do not really like coffee , to be honest . it is too bitter for me .
thanks ! now i do not need to come back to the shop a second time .
no , i have not got one by now . i will go to the interview of yours .
one of the common uses of pc is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores .
oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?
well , that seems easy enough .
you know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others .
i am sorry . there is nothing i can do about that . you have got to call the phone company .
i asked if there was anything i could do to help his family , and i told him that i could be a shoulder for him to cry on .
i want to watch it , but i was already tired by the time it came on . i had a rest instead , then i watched the news at channel 11 .
that is true , but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus .
i think that would be ok . who will be driving it ?
yes , i can write that on my calendar .
well , i think the waist is a little tight and the sleeves are too long .
did you read the books before you watched the movies ?
five . besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister .
all right . see you then .
nope . we just hope our employees will make profit for us .
actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
i will call you later .
now you should know the rest . do not forget to dial taipei is city code .
you bet . ebay taiwan does not have it ! and bidding will start at two thousand nt . this baby is worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ...
roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . is soup served here ?
no . but he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . many of us get very tired of this , and we would rather have weekends than stay in the office .
yes , but i need the report copied on transparency paper .
it began with a shiver then i perspired a great deal .
i will just go and check for you .
someone called drexler . carl drexler . he is been with the company onlytwo years . i have been here longer . and i know more about the job , too
and they lack originality . talent shows like ' super girl ' and ' super boy ' are largely clones of ' the american idol ' .
we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .
no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now .
yes , i did . i had a fine time .
no , just come here .
i do not know what to tell you .
on the internet ? i have never tried that way .
and your name , please ?
what i mean is that we will never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
mary is father is a rich man , is not he ?
i got it from ikea .
this only signifies that the toxins have left the body . actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . once it is over you feel very comfortable .
yeah . it is a must for me .
you see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . the wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
that does not sound pretty .
he is fine , but he had a fever last week . he probably just had a cold .
i will make note of that . now , what are your salary expectations ?
let me check with our credit manager . later our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . i do not think you will have any problems .
maybe that is true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you cannot go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it is just not respectful to you client .
have you ever talked to them about it ?
for almost two years .
you would need to speak to ms . stevens .
oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her .
i am a keyboard operator . what is your job ?
yes . now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in english . you will have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms .
oh , hey , no kidding ! i have not seen you since orientation three months ago ! so how have you been ? settling into college life ok ?
you always have a chip on your shoulder .
ok - let is do that then !
thank you for saying that .
ok , dear sister , i see . this kind of thing will not happen again .
what are you collecting donations for ?
it is all about credit rating and salary . if your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card .
that sounds pretty good ! how much is it ?
how could i ever forget ? i even bought you roses because i love you .
that is to say , love is blind .
you know why ?
yes , may i help you ?
my girlfriend just broke up with me .
great . thank you .
oh , no . too much work . i hate to sweat . it is so gross .
my first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip .
just the two of you ?
i agree , i had lunch there last week .
well , the company has some financial problems . people there are all thinking of quitting .
yes , we do . my parents prepare dinner for me .
you would not do a thing like that !
but there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
how far are you going ?
mr . robson , i am sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
not much really . it is more of an american tradition , so back home we do not really celebrate it . in fact , i am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated !
oh well . i will have to live with it . what else can i do ?
almost 30 of the consumers cannot accept the price . maybe we should lower our price a little .
well , i guess on friday , then you can eat .
not very well .
ah , yes , here you are ms . gleason . you reserved a single , right ?
ok , i will get this rate right away .
sometimes , usually once every few weeks . do you ?
does it make a lot of noise ?
do not worry about your driving test . i think you will pass the test and get the driver is licence very soon .
i am afraid you cannot . you will have to go out there and walk around .
it is nice to be here .
yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody is turned up , and i have to do the work alone . this is the first break i have had all day .
thanks , i like looking at photographs . how nice ! oh , i am afraid i must be going now . i have got an appointment . have a good day .
i will give you mine too .
do you think the plane will leave without me ?
that is great . i will take her .
i really need to get some things before i leave .
sounds good . where are we going ?
how did you get it ?
certainly , work always comes first .
that is a big change from 25 ! 10 is beyond my negotiating limit . any other ideas ?
can you do something about it ?
yes , there is one on the other side of the building .
i guess i never thought of that before .
yeah . i think so . you have to be patient and careful .
i am not sure where the bookstore is .
do you know a lot about cars ?
ok . next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees .
because i got my aa and now i am going towards my bachelor degree .
twenty dollars and sixty cents .
thank you . this place is nice .
that is a small fee ?
just a moment . i will make out your duty memo . writing and giving the memo to mr . green take it and pay the girl over there .
when i opened the account with you , i was a student , i graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so i figured now would be the best time to go ahead .
sure . are those pantyhose made of artificial silk ?
it is really cold . it snowed all day and the school closed early .
if you study hard , i do not see why you would not . have you received any other offers ?
thanks , i appreciate your help .
i do not want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
yes , just tinned meat .
our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
certainly . my name is janet smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
that is all right . what can i do ?
do not worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work .
not too well ! i am just to the doctor . i have not been feeling too well .. over the last few days .
what can we see in it ?
i know . i have to prepare the supper for the whole family before i leave .
you should have been done already .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
ah hah . thought you were't drinking .
no , i cannot see that happening . i know you are a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
the phone turns off by itself .
of course . i am not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there .
i wish he could too .
certainly . we can arrange the structure to suit whatever you require . that is why this service is so popular it is suitable for everyone because we make it that way .
i think it is a basketball match on channel 5 .
yes . steven smith , room 609 .
i know , but i still get my license , right ?
i know . but can you show me a little larger size ?
of course . it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance .
what about cash ?
i am afraid not . i have promised my girlfriend . we will travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
how will i know how much i can collect on unemployment ?
what are your annual salary requirements ?
yes , of course .
yes , i will take it . are there any jeans ? xiaohui is jeans are always dirty . i also need four pairs of slippers .
if the checked baggage is over the allowance , we will charge you for the overweight .
i would like to explain to you our financial position . the manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . it takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts .
you are welcome . it is our job to keep things running smoothly .
they were supposed to , but so far nobody is turned up , and i am left on my own to do the work . this is the first break i have had all day .
how much is the rent ?
does 7 of the clock suit you ?
he did . it was one of the best ones available . but that did not stop them from disabling 11 it . and on a crowded street too .
uh ... andrew . hello . i cannot quite remember you .
it is unbelievable . he used to be such a rough guy .
how did your previous employers treat you ?
i would like to have that new style gl joe .
that will be all . thank you very much .
sure i would .
that is because you did well .
i want to get some ground beef .
you must take a rest today .
sure here it is .
oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body .
do you have any other services available ?
it is a good idea . but where can we donate money ?
come on . we are going to be late .
there is no doubt that the brazilian team will win .
we do need some change in this country .
how about the podium ?
i am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . would you like to wait for a moment ?
do not worry about that , i am sure they will understand . after all , it was a very difficult exam .
okay . thank you . i understand now .
thanks . i will ask him .
how many days do i need to finish the course ?
no , i guess not . but that is what i want , is not it ? an efficiency .
no , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up ?
i heard it is included in the four major arts of china , is it ?

it is great ! unfortunately , we are going to spend a fortune doing everything up .
i was there .
yes , sir . we have the all-inclusive luxury cruise . maybe you would like to look at the itinerary .
just so so . there are no exciting things for me .
i agree . you cannot expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
i do not know . i hope it is nothing serious .
you ? you are full of hot air .
fine . how much is the charge per night ?
will you go with me , too ?
great ! we will send you all the details later . looking forward to meeting with you !
i know , but that movie was just too good to leave . i guess i will just have to pay the price and be sleepy .
well , things are all right .
first , you should open an account at the online bank . after that , you can buy anything you want online .
i do not think that will do . how about the one at your back ?
i am not really into racecar driving .
we have missed you too . the office just is not the same without you . how is your new job ?
we will get in touch with you by the end of next week .
yes , i remembered to bring my ticket with me today .

we have the room color designed for our guest .
well . good for him .
we have all kinds of movie channel packages .
of course . i can eat a horse now .
if you log in some formal websites , it must be very safe .

i did not mean to . it was an accident .
no , she is average .
get in . i will take you .
no problem , i can wait .
would you like to come to our barbecue ?
you would better attach these stickers to your carry-ons .
oh , that is the very thing i need .

can you deliver them earlier ?
you are welcome , bob . it was nice meeting you .
sounds interesting . what about this ?
sure . let is go .
but we may not get another partner .
he will be back at about five in the afternoon . could i take a message ?
yes , i will bring my plans with me to the meeting .
well , shall we go to the hotel right now ? i have already made a reservation for you .
all right . should i take a look at your battery ?
no trouble at all . he is very cute and brave . by the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks .
it happened in the morning . i just came home from work and found the lock broken .
how nice of him . i will be delighted to go . but what time would be convenient ?
see you later ! drive carefully .
one moment , please . i have to check if there are rooms available . i am sorry , ladies . we have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . would you mind that ?

what time will the library be closing ?

there is a service called ' a friend in new york ' . it is a personal tour guide service .
sure . what is this for ?
all right , steven . do you have a flashlight ?
hmm . if that is true , then the security there must be very good . because it is strange to think they will let people walk around in the white house .
till the end of the week .
oh , no . none of that .
here is your receipt . thank you for shopping here and have a nice day .
i want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself .

i am sorry , sir . can you tell me your room number ?
there is an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . we have a subsidiary company located there .
that has nothing to do with it ...
yeah , but it is expensive . nah , i am going to yy is .
sure , we are off singing road , close to the bank .
yes , i did . there is an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so i am sure i have not sent anything nasty to anyone .

i do not think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine .
you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea .
that is a secret .
eh , so so .
that is terrific !
no . we took a wrong turn somewhere . and joseph does not know the town at all . so i started giving him directions . but i did not really know where we were . so we got seriously lost .
what was it about ?
relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
anything else i should know ?

i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
no . constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people is health . so do not make your tea too strong .

she must have done a lot of work on it .
very well , ma ' am . oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it is rejected .
i feel much better now .
i struggle with organization and time management . punctuality has never been a strength of mine . i find it hard to organize my time efficiently . i have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . it helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so i think i am getting better now .

pot ? is not that marijuana ?
i will give you cash .
it was hardly all night . and i recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .

not at all . the changing rooms are just this way .
first please get the bill at the doctor is office , then pay it either with cash or by check . even though you are discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . do not hurry back to work until you have fully recovered .

that is my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games .
but it is really worthwhile .
of course ! will you ?
well , i am really worried about my grades . i did not think this course would be so stressful .
listen to some music ? and who will cook dinner ? will you ?

i think it is .
yes , that is what i thought . it is so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . so , what exactly do i need to do ?
that is too bad . is there a desk in the living room then ?
ok , sounds good . but i think it is your trick .
we should have a word with him .

who is the guilty party ?
ok , i lost 5 pounds .
i think it is time we started driving .
i had a nightmare last night and i dreamt arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . i was terrified to wake up after hearing that .

that is no problem . just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
yes , i know . after 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it is still under their warranty . their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .
did you take any pictures in the ocean ?
how dare you be so inconsiderate ? that is wrong .

my wife and i want to see the places of interest in shenzhen , guangzhou and zhuhai . can you arrange a tour for us ?

her new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air .
that sounds great . what time should i come over ?
that sounds great .
yeah , i am ok , i have been having a lot of mood swings lately . i think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones .

how do you want it ?
how much is it ?
i do not have onions on my list . i will add them . we should get some tea . is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?

they are on special offer today .
i think that it is going to rain .

oh , good . what time does the flight get to rome ?
oh , you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks .

sure . have you checked the weather report ?
what is it ?
we charge a 1 euro commission on each deal . how much would you like to change ?

robert , i have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else .

ok . dose it include breakfast ?
yes , of course . that is quite an important point , is not it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 hk dollars per annum . this does not include a generous housing allowance al
oh , yes , if you like . the large one goes to washington . the other one i will take with me . all right ?
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
i think you are absolutely right . ok , that is decided then !
i do not really know . i have just bought this new car . and it is the first time i have gotten gas for it .
you are great . could you say it in chinese ?
here you are .
not at all . i think the tattoos are so cool and chic .
oh . i am just going to take it easy .
what is the advantage ? price , i suppose .
thanks . by the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .
oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere .
and i will stick with real coffee .
why ? what is stressing you out ?
ok . take the underground the circle line to high street kensington . make sure you take the high street kensington exit .
i thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but i do not think the character development was that strong .
i have got it all covered .
you should not work so hard .
i am looking for the airport . can you tell me how to get there ?
it is snow .
a barber shop ? !
here is one tailor is shop . why not order one here ?
do you mind if i ask you why you have taken the part-time job here ?
oh , i do not know . i would buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , i suppose . but it is difficult to imagine having a lot of money .
great . so how long is the trip ?
everybody has their strengths and weaknesses . even larry . he might be a pain to be around , but he is also very good at staying in budget on projects . mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there is no tomorrow . also , she is never willing to stay a little later at the office . she always leaves at 5pm sharp .
i was not aware of that .
hah , hah ! see ? i guessed right . you were not watching the road at all .
but you should make up your mind first .
i asked if you come here often .
jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . i do not . i have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . every day , i wake up and head straight for the shower . every second day , i wash my hair . if it is a hair-washing day , i frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . then i usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . because my hair is so long , i seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . afterwards , i often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while i wait for it to brew . i take a long time to get dressed in the morning . every now and then i remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually i do it in the morning . in all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then i have to style my hair . from time to time i will put my hair up , but oftentimes i bloody it straight . and then , because of the texture of my hair , i regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . that is another twenty minutes or so . after that , i have my daily makeup routine .
okay . please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .
i hope you like it .
well , maybe you are right . we will be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway .
is there a discount for buying in large quantity ?
next week ? it is too late . i need it urgently .
just my cameras , my clothes , and some books .
could you please tell me about the cabins ?
that is right . i know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly .
it is my favorite .
it is an excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
that is guaranteed . each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping .
well , we try ! here , i just made some carrot juice . would you like a glass ?
you can look around our new workshops and the automatic machines .
so do we . certainly it is a step forward on your side . but the gap is still too wide .
you are welcome . and , please call me betty .

hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . i think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . and if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . and basically , that is about it .
wo will deliver the goods to you for free .
i am sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock .

yes . how do i get an outside line , please ?
normally i could not do that . but under the circumstances , i will see what i can arrange . customer satisfaction is our primary aim .
how do you want your eggs ?
thanks john , and there you have it ! looks like it is a weekend to stay at home !
how long have you been here ?
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of sep . we would like them to be there in time for our christmas sales .
i prefer a variety show without a host .
right . you have a choice of account , we provide usd , had , joy and gap accounts . which do you want to go for ?
i just want a light wave . i look really silly if my hair is too curly .
but , what do i do if i need cash ?
do you mean the red flowers ? they are peony flowers ?
great , so what happens now ?
maybe you are right . but i just still cannot understand ...
you are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?
what is it ?
i got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . get up and i will wait for you at the gate of our flat .
no , once i fill the tub with beer , i will get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better .
but many rich guys do not think they are truly happy . there is always some empty feeling deep inside them .
i do not mind . i am not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
what do you mean ?
she was right to do that . i heard the neil and tina getting married soon .
how about this ? they are the same shape .
yes . there are trains at 7: 59 , 9: 18 , and 10: 32 .
well , both have advantages and disadvantages .
what type of vacation time do we get ?
yes , i am .
ln this size , we sell it for 53 . 95 .
of course . it is just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you cannot find the right place .
but i think digest is supposed to be the top one . its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . it is quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .
ok . when should we be there ?
you have been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . you definitely deserve it .
yes , i am good with people .
thank you for your compliment .
oh , hi kim . how is it going ?
i hope you have a good stereo .
no , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint .
i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal .
could you give me a description of your case ?
sure . which button do i press to shoot ?
would you tell her tom gray called ?
describe her to me .
sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?
certainly . jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong . his chinese name is cheng long .
i am afraid that is a bit beyond my means .
what kind of work are you interested in ?
i see . i guess you can tell i do not travel much .
this one looks pretty good , but i would like to see more before i make up my mind . do you have any other suggestions ?
i am terribly sorry about that . we could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . would that suit you ?
it is easy to get loose bowels in summer .
yes , it is the same every day during the lunchtime rush . we will be putting in a new atm in the near future , though . that should help to ease the queues .
with the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks .
really ? well , ok , you are welcome .
thank you . i will need a cashier is check or cash , please .
ok . good night , then . have a good sleep .
that is a bit more than i was prepared to pay .
yes , i always cry at weddings .
just in beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day .
i am not . i just do not feel like drinking whole milk today . why ? do you think i am fat ?
i am looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift .
i need to make a deposit .
but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you .
to thank you for helping me at work last week . if you would not have been so kind , i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . you really did me a big favor . thank you so much .
who else has been here ?
i did not sleep a wink last night .
no . you are going to do the entire house .
the doctor has examined your current situation . since you are recovering so well , you will be discharged tomorrow .
the apples are 30nt each . how many would you like ?
was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?
i have a meeting this afternoon .
no , i cannot be there .
yeah , do you see his adam is apple ? it becomes bigger .
that is out of the question .
do not worry , james . we will get this case worked out in no time .
well , thanksgiving is family event . so on thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big thanksgiving dinner . kids will have lot of fun .
yes , certainly . i know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too .
good . fortune is usually ahead of the curve . and business week is very solid , too .
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this , and when i point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the e points .
i am a professor at a university .
what kind of drink would you like with that ?
well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . the things that are important to me are not important to him . we had a lot of conflicts .
thank you very much .
i am worried that she cannot catch up with her class .
sure , i think that would be possible . where is the fundraiser ?
are you available this friday ?
wait a minute . i did not catch you there . could you repeat that ?
that sounds like a great price . i will take one .
can you give me some idea of what you would like ?
me ? cook our dinners ? hah ! you will be cooking , dear . you will cook .
and those pencils ? what should i do with them ?
then , we have got plenty of time .
well , there is a lot of stress in a chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . i have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . if i have a problem with a co-worker , i do everything i can to work it out directly with that person . if i am unable to work it out , then i ask a supervisor to help out . if my boss shouts at me , i try not to take it personally . i try my best to understand the stress he is under . it is kind of like being in a family . often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but do not mean what they say . a company is like a family , it has good times and bad times .
well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . if you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do .
that was 5264453 6 , right ?
this loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items .
let is see , sir . according to your file , you watched ' titanic ' monday evening .
i know , i know . well , is there some , is there someone else ? oh , that woman on television , sydney ann .
you are a lost cause .
that is what will keep you from being thirsty .
hey , look outside ! it is started to drizzle !
i am not going to show any income from now on then .
what do not you like about it ?
thanks . my name is nick .
what were you supposed to write it out for ?
i would like to buy a shirt .
which of them is the local train , please ?
no , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that .
this is good to go . if she wants accessories , just visit us again .
why is it relatively expensive ?
yes . i am a transit passenger for this flight . can you tell me where to go ?
yes . we regret we cannot maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
i really like the jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .
i appreciate it . thank you .
no . but i thought that you could start with reading and then go from there .
spread some jam , please .
boxing . it was excellent .
it was a great game .
ok , i see . thank you !
i am having a party this friday .
one-way , please . i am flying back to london from shanghai .
are not there any other seats ?
no , but you never know when you will need a flashlight .
that is the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
think about it !
yeah . he really does let me down .
why not ? i love animals and i love nature .
yes , the climate of france rarely has severe winters . in southern france , one can live in comfort the whole year . is japan good for farming ?
you are not going to make anything to eat ?
how is it going on ?
oh , i see . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors .
i have read your application materials with interest . now i want to ask you a few questions , if you do not mind .
she has blond hair and blue eyes .
you are probably right . i just wish it were that simple . how can i stop feeling so anxious all the time ?
all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 and profit margins from 50 to 80 .
where is it located ?
yes , i am sorry about that . one of our atms is down and we are waiting for it to be repaired , but it should be up and running again very soon .
that sounds really interesting . can you speak swahili ?
yes , i see .
can you stand ?
oh , really , that is really something new . i am afraid not everyone can accept it .
sorry , i could not help you .
for sure another day .
yes , please . and i will need an economy class open return .
not yet ... i got an mp3 player and a set of stereo headphones .
i really hope that i could sleep like a log all through two nights . but ... some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them .
is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment .
where is your domicile place ?
would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ?
yes , you need the traveler is check but you need not get any foreign currency . you can have my us dollars , i do not need them .
we have got a 2 weeks ' vocation and we plan to leave on thursday .
hey , she is not worth it . forget her .
what happens if you exceed the limits ?
yes , you are right . good night .
i am in a bit of a hurry , miss liu . can you wait for a minute ?
it is a well furnished eat-in kitchen . the stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is ok , too .
i wonder if the chops are fresh .
oh , i understand . i cannot say i am a big fan . i am from china , and football does not have a really big following over there .
ok , for starters we have tom yam soup . it is a bit spicy , but really good !
yes , but i have unusually big feet . that would not be too much of a problem except that they are also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into .
ok . people decorate their houses , place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together .
thank you so much . by the way , is there a mail service ?
all right . no problem . what is your extension ?
it was horrible ! i played play it much better at home !
what do you mean by this ? you cannot do the two things at the same time .
just pass the gym and it is the first door on your left . were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ?
women always have the last word .
well , i guess if you are sigrid and roy you can keep a tiger or lion . i guess all types of things do not they .
she already bought that evening gown .
that is a good idea .
i can understand . by the way , is there anyway i can help ?
yes i know , but i just got the chance to leave and so i am going to take it no matter what .
you are waltzing quite wonderfully . it is great to dance with a experience and talent partner .
when i tried to back it , i found it was out of order . i cannot see where the trouble is .
ok , then 50 yuan for dessert . 500 yuan all together .
if all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can .
i insist . i really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . what is your favorite fast food ? i will cater to your taste .
when can i go inside then ?
yes , of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
we can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 . with corporate tax at say 30 . we are only paying on 50 of this . there is still inflation to consider .
well ... i told them not to come . i made a reservation just for the two of us . i thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves .
can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?
true , but english is harder than most . it is a crazy language .
what are your plans for the future ?
the price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . there are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance .
what is that ?
he knows who i am .
how much time do you need ?
i am sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
no , you do not have to . it is a duty-free shop .
i work for the bank of china , in the international section .
you are welcome .
yes , that will be just as good .
what is the starting salary for me ?
what colors do you have in foundation ?
here you go . is there a minimum amount i need to pay in ?
oh , i hope he did not notice me .
i am a bank manager .
it must be cold in the winter , though .
they have made it . will our love last 50 years ?
i will remind you to get off .
i can fit you in on that day at 10
i absolutely love the apartment .
i would like to fly next friday .
ok , the form is all filled out .
wow . we do not get to see this in the city !
i want to buy a pair of shoes for an interview .
there are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes .
anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
please go to see a doctor .
have you booked already ?
sure ! what exactly do you have questions about ?
i sure did .
i honestly do not know .
what happened to you last night ? you did not show up .
then we will come here for lunch tomorrow .
yes . i think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people were not concerned with what other people might think . in a way , the designers are saying do not worry about what others think . wear what you like ! ' .
i usually go every other day for about 3 hours .
what about jeans ? it is the fashion now .
we celebrate it on the first sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of march .
i would like to go to tianjin .
i think you would better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth .
an ethiopian restaurant ? whoa ! i always think of starving people in ethiopia .
of course not . i am just observing casual day . on fridays , the company does not require us to wear formal business attire .
i was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
what store did you get it from ?
yes , that sounds like a good idea .
tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker .
why , what is the problem ?
sure , what is up ?
not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they were not the criminals after all .
i think i will use my credit card .
how tall is this building ?
that is great . thanks very much . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
yes , i am , but i think it is time for some plastic surgery i am tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . see ?
i would really like a salad with chicken .
yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .
i need to continue to deal with my business . i have not finished it yet .
i usually enjoy the meals here , so i think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal .
thanks for saying . do you have any ideas which necklace i should wear ?
i will pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ?
only then did i realize it was april fools ' day .
yes , i know . a friend of mine is a guide . he talked with me about his work , but i do not mind working hard .
what is her figure ?
relly ? that is amazing .
the same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us .
but we could just stay there for 20 minutes .
if you ask me , i have to disagree . something should not be watched for fun .
it is not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools do not seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
of course ! peking duck is world-famous . i would love to try it .
yes . are you ?
if you make mistakes in your job , you will be fired . is that right ?
ok , let is go .
thank you very much .
i suppose i could .
how in the world ! who came up with seats like that from your company ?
i am not sure yet .
ok , i will be with you in a moment .
do you know other famous animals in the world ?
well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
i will bring it over .
well , why do not you try to get some exercise ? it is difficult , but very rewarding .
oh , no wonder you are healthy .
what is that ?
your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at hong kong . how about shipping them from seattle instead of network ? you may choose either one as port of shipment . it makes no difference to us . there are more sailings from seattle than from new york .
i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
and who do you sell to ?
but your were playing video games all afternoon . you are skating on thin ice .
ok , thank you .
i am glad to hear it .
sounds pretty good . is it a tragedy ?
come on ! it will be fun . we play every other saturday afternoon from may until august .
yes . i am leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say good-bye to you .
i do not believe ads . what is more , i am already in perfect health .
sure , please give me $ 10 in advance . l wil have them bought for you .
that is right .
problems are inevitable .
i am getting this beret ? does not it look cool ? i would like to get some jeans too , but i do not have enough cash on me .
well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but i think the black one will suit you better .
okay , give me the roses .
you said this was the right stop .
thanks for your help .
take it easy . we are going to have our own baby . you should be happy .
perfect . are you prepared to give me all your money ?
scraping is too terrifying . when they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . it looks like someone beat you up .
even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' but it now ' prices .
in half an hour . the surface of the lake is calm .
i changed my strategy around too . i invest in good companies now .
i will give you five more minutes , then i am going on without you !
ok , please wait a minute . can i have my food packaged ?
would you love to introduce me to her ?
all right . i am afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . it is smaller than the blue one . i do not like the colour either . it does not suit me at all . i think the blue dress is prettier . co
so i have noticed . you are putting on a little weight , are not you ?
we have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . this means that no mistakes are made .
in that case , i will not keep you any longer . drop in any time .
tom , if you can hear me , i think we have lost you . there is a problem with the line . let is try again . we will call you .
what do you offer in terms of a retirement plan ?
i could do that .
i am afraid not , nick . that is the best i can do .
just some souvenirs .
i would like to return some books .
are you very close to your first-cousins ?
yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 yuan .
all right , then . i will see you at noon on wednesday .
i see . but is not it a bit too noisy ?
because it was her husband who beat her .
will you be kind to say thank you to mr . zhang and other friends for me ?
i cannot understand him anyway .
i am looking for a sweater .
this seems a pretty nice room , i should say .
well , we have some new barbie dolls .
you are welcome . have a nice trip !
for what day ?
is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
says who ? i do not think that is necessarily the case .
nothing is to your satisfaction .
she is very funny . she makes me laugh all the time .
that is because you do not know the short cuts . you will learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes .
that is ok , then ? starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car .
it is very careless of me to have broken your glass .
those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . also , some employees receive sales commissions . so good salesmen will naturally earn more .
great ! is a trainer available ?
i will . thank you , mummy .
yes . it was so crowded . i am worn-out . let is find our seats .
i heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year .
oh yes , i know which one you mean . i have never been there , but i looked at their menu once and it did look good .
i will appreciate it if it could be arranged .
no , i want a double room . by the way , is there any discount for children ?
i would be very pleased .
i will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . i am very excited about it now .
it is too big for me . could you recommend something else ?
you mean i am among the people who have to go ?
actually , i am interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision .
ok , let is go .
but i never saw them .
that is ok . a month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . it would be great to have you with us on the show .
good . good luck to you !
here is your change and receipt . thank you .
just calm down . it is just a turnover . make up your mind and we can shoot well .
good idea . can i bring some music from that period too ?
that would be nice , thank you .
well , i have always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?
the way i see it is that they would join us .
wow , thank you for telling me these . do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
i have got the correct change already .
at the gym ?
yeah . how about ' happy birthday tony , from the gang . '
could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ?
go ahead , please .
every night my roommates watch the korean soap operas till mid-night . i am not a big fan of korean shows and i do not know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings .
here you are . do you need glue ?
i wish i could be one of those people , but my budget simply does not stretch that far . i have to limit the amount of money i spend on clothes otherwise i would go on a shopping frenzy .
covering all expenses ?
good luck with school .
that is fine . thank you .
fine , thank you for coming . mr . wu , please take a seat . i am anne smith , the assistant manager .
i think so .
really ? what time do you go to work ?
i need your library card .
the streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ?
can i pay by check ?
503 . i would like to pay for it .
yes , at the end of the hall .
sure , would you like any appetizers today ?
we have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot .
that will be good . you are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away .
thank you very much . i will see you the day after tomorrow .
you need to take some breaks throughout the day . studying all day is not very usually effective .
really ? when is it on ?
yes , i would like a chocolate shake .
yes , miss . what was the problem with your purchase ?
this is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . have a good trip !
how about 60 for the first load , then 20 each ?
i thought we will just fix up the wood floor . and use some paint for the walls .
i have poison oak , and i need help with the rash that will not stop itching .
what concoction are you making ?
you had been walking for 6 hours , is not that boring ?
yes . i brush my teeth in the morning , just before i go to work . it is actually the last thing i do before leaving . then i brush again before bed .
one minute . oh , yes , here we are . you are flying economy class , are not you ?
ok ... do i put on magnolia company for the receiver ?
yeah , sorry .
one minor problem , sir . our prices are now slightly higher . is that acceptable , sir ?
no , i would not worry about you .
it was a kind of sixth sense .
let me see .
you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
oh , no ! i have got all i need for my stay here .
fine , thank you , and you ?
do i really have to do it ? i do not know how .
i will put it on my visa card , then .
thank you . could you show us to our table now ?
is there a problem ?
yes , sir . your shirts will be ready by thursday morning . anything else ?
thank you for all of the information . i will help you find the perfect house for you .
sorry , mr . wood is not here right now . do you have any message for him ?
not from this brand , i am afraid .
take your time .
they name it after the place where it was first held .
we will see .
you went out and bought khakis , too !
do you have some chocolate cakes ?
yes . i dare say it will be .
that sounds really neat . is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?
i am twenty-five years old .
no , dad . can i go there to play ball ?
can i just call someone myself to fix it ?
so you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ?
thank you , i will be right back . do you need any to go boxes ? i would be glad to bring you some when i come back .
no problem , we pay 3,000 rib per month . plus a 20 commission on all , a company car and other benefits . all travelling expenses will be reimbursed by the company . do you have any other questions ?
that is great .
believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . employees are actually more productive on casual days .
certainly . it is right over there .
how about making hong kong the port of shipment instead of new york ?
yes , i did . i passed !
well , i just hope it will level off .
are all of your team members on schedule ?
i see . then i will try it .
yes , i need to talk to him .
to be honest , it looks like your old carpet . is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ?
i am so sorry to hear that . maybe you should go to the information counter over there . they can give you some advice .
of course you can . every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but do not chat over the phone . what is more , do not let it hinder your work and the company is business .
ok . dinner and a movie will be perfect .
what about historic festivals ?
then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . two for one .
who composed it for your ?
but peter and tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago . now it is full .
medium , please .
just let it be . her rudeness will come back to haunt her .
i cannot see it .
it is two year and covers parts and service .
now that is a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i am feeling better already .
they are two cameras .
is it full ?
no , he walks . he likes walking . he meets some of his friends at the corner another go together .
listen to the sound of nature ! it is like music .
it looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out .
do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . the best choices here are evident cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs you cannot go wrong with them . as for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , i would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil .
yes , we can handle that here . how can i help you ?
i am watching you .
why do not we do that anymore ?
i know what overbooked is , i just do not understand how that could happen ?
thanks mom ! can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake !
do you like egg soup or mutton soup ?
honestly , it is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time .
no , have they had another fight ?
you are right .
i am very impressed .
no . but if something goes wrong with it , i know someone who repairs these things .
okay , that is fine .
i just want the problem taken care of .
i see , yes , i can do that now . i am sure you know , as i may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 rib handling fee for this service .
your total comes to $ 7 .
that is right .

let is see . we spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month .
sure , but every coin has two sides . doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways .
have you finished school ?
do not worry about it , just ask .
i have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet .

how long is the tour ?
not at all .
that is what i was afraid of .
i have got no kite . do you have one ?
yes , but it is not much . you just have to pay 1 interest on the account . it is much lower rate than any of our loans and it is much better than owing money to most credit cards .
if one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ?

he is a little sick under the weather .
she is in a meeting until noon .
she is at the supermarket downstairs . she said she would be back in about half an hour .
i think you are right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?
is this to go or to eat here ?
that is everything , but can i add channels later ?
it is nine of the clock now . and i will wait for him .
yeah , the buildings and designs of the forbidden city are the peak of chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living .

do you know where your classes are ?
how nice ! i can see you are busying packing . i am sorry to interrupt you .
no . it is no problem . are you american ?
it is basically a very strong espresso . half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . pure coffee essence .
and i have got to drive . you know i am not fond of that . i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
what should i drink then ?
not really , i like watching horror movies , like ' the unborn . '
what about this one ? it is the latest .
well , he indeed likes me .
when i was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
i am sure that science will explain everything eventually . i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
how bad did i do ?
i am having dinner with my family
so he talks about you behind your back ?
i do not understand why i cannot just pay you .
let me see . yes , they are perfectly matched !
you have got to be joking .
wait a moment . i will calculate it for you . your bill comes to $ 36 .
it is 260 dollars .
they are blind with bucks . blind people are more easily conned , fo course .
he must be green . it is lucky that we will get off soon .
this is worth trying .
yes , i do .
then send them a sms on their cell phone .
yes , i would like to close my account .
how could have the heart to do that ? she needs warmth and help .
what do you mean ?
that would really help me a lot . i am very grateful .
sure . what is up ?
and the tv program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .
it is all the way to the back . see that yellow door ?
did you go to berlin ?
that should not be a problem . what is the exact address , again ?
oh , it is love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
i bet he is . he domed his own life .
i bumped it by accident , but i did not mean to do it .
let me stretch it for you . how is that now ?
yes , i agree with you . we should add our opinions to the research report .
what were you planning on seeing ?
it would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done , but thank you for a lovely dinner .
oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i am still trying to find my place in this world . it is only recently that i have been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn
you have a choice of vegetables , green peas , lima beans or spinach .
i am afraid there is nothing available before noon .
do they serve the yogurt with anything ?
not for a couple of years . what happened to her ?
no , its very casual there . leave your jacket and tie at home .
i am going to a disco with my friends .
sure . any time .
mr . black , if i am not mistaken .
well , i think there is one across from the shopping center .
well , perhaps that is the reason why you are so fluent in it .
i can speak french and german .
right . i enjoy what i am doing .
yes , but i doubt if i get it . i have never got it .
it is hard to commute a long way .
yeah , that will be great . i am on extension 4283 .

all right . please be quick about it .
i am just glad there were no complications .
a trim and perm .
when will it be working again ?
really , john . i still think you should go to a doctor . you have been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . why do not you take this afternoon off ? if you do not want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest .
i had to look after my son at home .
i want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer .
after i sign it , you must take it to the admissions and records office to add the class . do you know where that is ?
ok , i will have mr . baker call you as soon as he comes back .
i have a typical 9 to 5 job . actually , i work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days .
good . i am a regular customer here . i am glad you can make an exception for me .
was it your first time ?
hello . i would like to speak to someone regarding my card .
what did they say ?
i could try , but i cannot say for sure if i will get up in time . what time do you want to go ?
oh , yes . i heard of a lot of about it . i like very much to try it . where can i find it ?
that is a high price .
have you voted yet ?
i have been doing quite well . as reach 90 and bs reach 100 . and i have been awarded zu jingle scholarship two times .
do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
great , thanks .
no ! oh , my god ! someone has broken into the house .
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
i do not think so . you look full of energy every day . time has stood still with you .
i see . but i have to discuss it over with my boss before i make a decision .
usually it is the older kids going around playing halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people is doors or - - someone is tree . they usually do it late at night after little kids go

will you please pose for your picture ?
what happened to you ? you look like you got hit by a tornado !
what time do you want to leave the hotel ?
i think i know who you are talking about .
well , the stereotype in the movies is that l . a . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . i guess , in the back of my mind , that is what i expected .
but this is maybe one of the best haunted houses in north america ! it is different .
fine ! i will reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . may i have your name , please ?
next time you are in shanghai , please let me know , and let me be of some assistance to you .
i agree . i am carry about mice . i think they are so cute !
slot machines ? no , i do not want that ! that is too boring . i want a game with cards or dice .
it is said that the cowherd and the spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh eve , so this day has become the lover is day .
what is the matter
i will dress up as a vampire with big fangs .
turtles ? whatever ... look , all that is required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . at least , that is what the math says .
ok , mr . ma . i will tell the front desk clerk the charge afterwards .
oh , so you took an art class ?
which one would you recommend ?
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
why do not you wear a scarf ?
perfect ! you will be working alone on that portion . do you like to work alone ?
regular , please .
there we are ! it is a lovely vase .
what would you like to return ?
no . i transferred here from a different school .
i am not sure yet . i may take the train but then again i might take the bus .
i am glad to hear that .
all right . i will do my best .
someone has stolen my gold necklace .
these are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
well , i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway , i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave .
i hope not . it is not that busy .
do not sweat it . i know just the guy .
oh , that is quite convenient . thank you .

really ? what about the pay rate ? are the wages pretty high ?
i hope so .
these are all my personal documents about my education and working experience you asked for . and i have to be off for an important meeting now . if you think i am right for the job , please keep me informed .
so , even if someone was not directly involved , they can become involved ? like the bank you cash it in ?
how about your experience ?
see you later .
fine . i will be there around two . if someone is not there , i will use my key to get in .
i went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small .

jim chan . the account is in my name . is that all you need to know ?
steven ! what is going on ! who were those guys ? i did not know you have a gun ! what is going on !
the coupon can be used at least one year .

yes , that is correct . we will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy .
yes . i would like to cash my travelers ' check . here you are .
why not go again to celebrate out one year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you able to operate the telex ?
all right , i see . so the medicare is not actually a health insurance i can use now .
how much will i be fined ?
i have a bad headache , but ...
oh ! thank you .
i can afford about $ 800 a month for rent .
8 . is your vip room big enough for 8 persons ?
paranoid ? i am not paranoid ! i am cautious ! you see dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! people just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! they have way too much information ! i like to keep everything on a need to know basis .
yes , i would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper .
i have heard about it , but i am still waiting for my invitation .

well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
i will trust your taste and take one order of that .

mr . rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday .

to cancel your reservation , i need your name , phone number , and date of trip , please .
then why do not you try the chef is steak special ?
hmm , that is a bit of a challenge . sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . well , let is see . have to be a white wine , of course .
it is nice , but that is very steep for a rain coat . could you give me a 20 percent discount ?
the tuition is the same for all of them .
so i have got two tickets to the latest show but i need a little favor from you .
oh , fine . let is take a look .
he has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before .
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
i am sorry , could you be a little more specific ?
i guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the milton contract .
you certainly made a good impression on me as well .
oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ?

well , if you change your mind , let me know .
but the bank should be closed so we should not to be able to get some money .
name brand is not necessary . anything decent will be fine .
no problem . here you are .
you must tell your embassy about it . and i think they will issue you with a new one .
uh ... yeah .. of course !
they take care of a lot of things .
i thought you were making dinner tonight .
well , the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
yes , i like it very much .

where do you need it to be delivered to ?
i had to run in and get something quickly .
about 15 . i have seen him work hard for a lot of good changes .
right , to be famous to be respectable in some way .
oh , i do not know ... it is hard to find the right nanny . you have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . i would love to have
right . here it is .
well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted .

i heard that you moved to florida .
your discount is already included . normally we charge 400 , but now we can give you a special price . this is our sale period .
you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you will have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
oh , great ! i love it ! you know i have been expecting this for a long time .
it must be kate .
shoulder chops , ms chan ?
i think that they do not complete the forms correctly or they do not include all the required documents . the embassy is very strict about it . you have to be quite careful .
therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
what was wrong with you ?
ok , here are the clothes .
without traffic , it takes about an hour .
where shall we go next ?
we call this a ' parking meter ' .

they are discussing whether they should replace miss smith , the music teacher .
really ? i really want to have a try !
where are you going ?
a double room without a view for just one night ?
yes , what seems to be the problem ?
we would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom .
it was better than i expected . but , you know , i think i would have enjoyed skiing in tahoe even better . do you go there often ?
i am having an exam at nine , it is already eight thirty .
not exactly , but i see your point .

thank you so much .
i will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away .
congratulations . that is great !
talent is a great thing , i wish i had one .
i used to work as a mechanic and i was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles .
it does not matter . you gotta find what she is interested in and go with that .

we share the same desire . have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ?
this one is good .
how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you are singing it to your fiancee brooke !

okay , i will get the car out of the garage .
what a pity !
have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?
you will not see me here again .

i do not want cheese on it .
good . i wish i could have another vacation .
that is remarkable .
everybody is buying them .
in the meantime , do i still have to pay for the cable ?
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo is with low co-pays and good coverage . the deductibles are low , too .
there are limitations to the capacity of an e-mail . commonly it is no more than 4 mb .
well , it is sounding good ! i am looking forward to that .
well , will you please put them down ?
ok , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . i think i saw a promotion for pastrami . also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives .
you are very lucky to have such a nice family .
what am i being tested for ?
how about the price and the bank mortgage ?
thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
about 1,500 metres per minute . it is one of the fastest in the world . we had a few problems with it after start-up but it is running very well now .
what about laundry ?
i was just as shocked when i found out .
why do not you re-take the class next year ?
i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts !
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
would not you like some more chicken ?
come on ! man up ! you will never know until you try .
yes , that sounds like what i want .

we have information available about the job market as well as workshops .
getting worse . now he is eating me out of house and home . i have tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . he makes himself at home , which is fine . but what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and i had company over ! that was the last straw .
and this bedroom is too big and damp . but it is better than a tent .
sure . mom , i can take care of you .
oh , the day after tomorrow is christmas .
i do not think i share your view there . the writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on . it is too hard to understand .
no . i was way too busy studying all the time . how about you ?
the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it is ok .

i do like thai food . did you see much of bangkok ?
i would like a flower-and-bird painting .
geez ! what is the rush ?
let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st .

according to the article , you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human .
how many in your party ?

i have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice .
is there anything else i should do ?

i was wondering , i have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . also , i have heard the rumor that you speak fluent japanese . is that right ?
wait ! you cannot do so many things at the same time . what exactly do you want ?
well , i know a little italian .
she is trying to be supportive , but i can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well .
but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans .
oh , do not be so strict ! we are in las vegas .

yeah me too . oh ! can we stop at the shop really fast ? i lost my makeup bag at the airport and i want to pick up a few things .
that is a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and yet you will not expect your body to work without food .
yes , exactly , because i want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date .

i see . how do i draw money for my own use then ?

let me see ... yes , 15,880 nt . after the discount , your total comes to 12,704 nt . here is your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application .
it is not what you are thinking . these events will give us a wider exposure than most . take the tri-city marathon for starters . this is a highly publicized event . the television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness .

that is why i am going to leave .

wonderful ! i will often come here for mountain climbing .
i would like to see the menu , please .
is it convenient and cheap ?
it sounds cool . the rhythms look really difficult .
nothing much , what is going on ?
anything else , sir ? should i check the water and the oil ?
no , mom , i can manage it by myself . his help just causes more trouble .
i know . i should have called .

one of the girls in my office .

any time between 8 a.m . to 9 p.m .
i am glad you are here ! see if you can find the problem .

james cameron , of course .
but i did not get the ticket . and it is said that they were sold out yesterday .
holy cow ! i never heard of such a thing . how much do they cost ?
roman is living in rome , of course . and go to work by car , or bus , or on foot .
i think that is too late .
that is true , i guess . if i did not have to work , i think i would be happy .
hi , i would like to make a dinner reservation .
it was really fun chatting with you .
sure , thanks . i brought you a bottle of wine as well .
i see . so this card helps me to keep track of my progress .
the end of this month .
it is a bit expensive . can you tell me the schedule ?
the place is a must-see . this zoo was built in 1862 , and it is the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . there are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats .
let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle .
i am afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .
i could not careless .
yeah , i will .
that is for sure . you know , it is really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . i had the greatest time ever .
then i might as well have it out now .

you are right .

no need . i think it is still plenty full . even so , i would rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
hmm . thank you very much .
yes i can . i speak it very well .
that is fine , sir . we will see you again a little later .
cannot beat that ! thank you accounting guy !
yeah , it is not that long of a trip .

you can always go to gramercy tavern . it is quite popular , despite its expensive entrees .

is it a used one ?

no , ah ... single sellers .
what makes you say that ?

are you kidding me ?
maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . the price is the same and it is bigger .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i would not get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .

by the way , what is the charge for the tailoring ?

i want to go to see a movie this weekend .
great . are you a qualified teacher ?
i am going to take more pictures today .
yeah , i crave my own space . i just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . we all need our private space . but i also think interpersonal skills very important . living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .

my old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period .
i do not care .
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .

that is great . can you speak chinese ?
no , of course not . just in case . nothing to worry about . do not you also do this in china ?
jeez . tourists .
i go as much as i can . i love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature .

i did not know you were a vegetarian !
hey ! i thought you were not interested ! sorry , i have gotta go ! i am going to switch over to ebay and see if my bid is still the highest .
i can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . we have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods .
how long will the sub contractors be on site ?
my paper is on the influence of television on children .
i am surprised you do not use more of the features on your phone .
i see . that is probably a good idea . too many forest are being destroyed .
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed .
we could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . they might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets .
right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond .
we only need to verify your information against our records .
did you get the camera ?
it is zn741 to atlanta on july 1st .

look at this mountain bike . it is only 330 . do you like it ?
it is my pleasure .
i am afraid that he cannot , mr croft . cannot you wait till this afternoon ?
is it far from here ?
how do you like it ?
ok , see you soon .
hello , there . i would like to know about clean collection . my company in the us is going to send me a cheque . it is for my wages , but i am not too sure about how to cash it here .
yes , we do . you will go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . why do not you read through this brochure ? it outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
everything i need is in this box ?
of course not ! we built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . we went sliding on the nice hill . it was a real work out . at noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . you must come with us next time . i bet you will love it .

what can i do for you today ?
i really find chinese dishes more to my taste .
yes , that is possible .
yes . when can i get it back ? i cannot wait to see the photos .
you dare to doubt me ?
it gets better on sunday , though . the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . it will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . the west coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . i advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . back to you , mark .
i would be happy to help . what would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when i passed by this morning . so , let is have a try . my treat .

ok , i will do it right now .
i see , we have explanation leaflet on the table . if you follow the directions it is quite simple .
let is put our suitcases on the rack .
yeah , this is my first visit here .
i do not think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?
what are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ?
i am not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan , do not you ?
how do you celebrate it ?
yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
thanks , i will .
all right , thanks .
yes , the wine list is at the end of the menu .
oh , no . but cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . and we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . here are the pictures . pick out something you like .
i have never used one before .
i am very sorry for that , but i sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and i had to look afer her .
they do the work without charge to the importer .
all right , thanks .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
how long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ?
i will say ! sometimes they just do things really differently . but one thing i can say , they are really hospitable .
what do you think will make you happy ?
i picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . afterward , i taught myself by listening to some records of top players .
f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you are done ...
i do not feel like going out tonight , i am way too tired . i miss you , sweetheart .
turn the lights off . then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
i agree with you . what do you want to do , except sleeping ?
oh , yes . just show me where the fitting rooms are now . i cannot wait to try this on .
you have asked me several times about it . you are driving me up the wall .
i enjoyed it , even though i had not asked for it .
would you like them delivered ?
haggis ? what is haggis ?
you know , i think it would be better if i could pick it up in three days .
let me check ... yes , we got the october issue a few days ago . it is on that shelf over there .
well ... hum . you are sure you will not lose control of yourself ?
i took a few diving classes , but i did not really like it , so i did snorkeling instead !
come on , do not flatter me anymore . i took the job because i love being challenged . but i cannot get this turned around without the support from you people .
why do you say so ?
yes , i know a great place . what types of food do you like ?
you can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly quanjude restaurant .
i did not realize until after our date that they were not my type .
take your mind off it . look , crys . this magazine is on china is top ten beauties !
you have to be there two hours before departure time .
del is better than dial-up ?
you just have to build up a tolerance . i used to be like that . but your body gets used to it .
it was not that loud .
i know of a place you will like and you have got to be there .
i suppose so . hair cut , please .
you have come to the right place . we have got the best shoes in town .
yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i am not going to be angry . now why were you late ?
i guess so . even though i seem to be over the worst of it . i do not want to give the bug to anyone in the office .
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
thank you , i will be doing my best .
what is the weather like in spring ?
are you aware of all the controls in the car ?
that is right .
well , is there any other hotel nearby ?
certainly , sir . how much do you draw ?
a bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for bob , he is been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement .
yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating .
take care , and give my best to your parents .
absolutely . mm , this is really good .
extension 162 . okay , mr . suzuki . i will give him the message .
but i get scared the moment i see a needle . how could i stand having needles in my body for hours on end ?
i am sure i can get it from another library .
thanks a lot .
i see that you have some impressive writing experience .
i did , but he gives me a runaround .
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
i am done .
go straight ahead through the intersection .
all you need to do is sign up at any one of our branches and you can use the service right away .
so you are free on saturday night ?
what is the difference between an outlet and a regular store ?
that sounds good . i think i will have the same .
hmm . i see what you mean . have you spoken with roger ? he usually does better work than this .
then one hundred u . s . dollars covers everything , does not it ?
my wallet and cell phone .
i prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice .
where is the house ?
kebabs and roast squid .
oh , it is so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
then i will send it by air , thank you .
yes . i have bought all the things to go in it . it will not take long to make . how many people are coming to the party ?
have we got any beer and wine ?
not really . but i really love to have after-meal tea .
i thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . things like that . i do not have any vegetables .
that would be a possibility . where is this fundraiser taking place ?
it was a real red letter day for you .
what is it ?
no , i did not hear about that .
well , for many international students , coming to the united states and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus .
there are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age .
and which side of the business do you work in ?
summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . i love the summers in my city , but i hate the wintertime .
i stayed up all night writing a report .
everyone in taiwan knows it . come on ! sing with us !
do you think any studios will open up soon ?
of course ! let is go .
yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i have been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and i still have not received
i think he has realized that . but he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act .
maybe you are right .
that is too bad . they are such good company .
the subway ? but is there a subway station next to my hotel ? i have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ...
tell me more .
they were delivered this morning .
right . but people at that time only know two words , save and assistance , they will never do not lift a finger . life is the most important compared with anything else .
when did you go there ?
we have got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you will have to bring your own sunlounger .
he may be injured . yes , come on , call the team doctor .
that is right . that is when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .
how dare you speak to me like this .
yes . and you are paul , right ? paul hill ?
no , and i have no way of getting ahold of him ! there is no phone where he is at !
have you chosen the material ?
that girl in my econ class . she is so hot .
so funny . by stealing , i forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work .
you are welcome . bye .

yes , that is the reason why i remain here .
good ! me too ! by the way . you did not tell me what you are studying here .
this machine roasts the beans just right . if you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ...
some resolutions ? that is a wonderful idea , but i have no idea yet . how about you ?
ok . we will take it .
as long as we are going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
really ? what !
is it ? i have never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
here is my card . can i have them delivered to this address ?
give me your email , would you ?
fine , thank you . and you ?
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ?
i suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .
i was in tokyo in august , and it was really hot and humid . i went to kyoto in october . it was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity .
sounds great ! i will be there .
the pleasure is mine .
i have cut the price the minimum . you know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . we could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . this price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit .
ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday , right ?
yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt . it is better to have a fire in your house when you are not home . do not you think ?

people fall in love with people they work with . that is a fact .

i have not eaten there before .
smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments .
daisy is in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . she thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
very good , sir . a table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . may i have your name , please ?
i am fine , mom . i feel so much better . i want to go to school . i am missing out on all the fun .
what is that ?
what are your salary expectations ?
i want to make a deposit today .
he is still pretty sick .
ok , let is go check out the kitchen next .

i am going to sweep the floor first .
i am glad to hear that . in case he is not insured , the hospital will never accepts any patient .
it says that it comes in teal and tangerine .
no , it is just that it is a holiday . with everyone out partying , there is a lot of drunk driving .
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss .
whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they are easy for me .
do not worry . everyone knows you are getting your feet wet . i will show you how . i bet you will be proficient at this in five minutes .
ok . take care . i hope you have a good journey .
that is the best i can do .
yes , but i could not help it . i was late getting off work for a start , and then i missed the bus . the bus i did catch got caught in a traffic jam . it was one thing after another .
can we meet each other half way ?
sure . coming right up .
i do not think so .
no problem . we also need bread , so i will go to the baker is . i will get some vol au vents for victor is birthday bash on friday . we will need balloons for that too .
here you go . anything else ?
i am still hungry .
is that true ? but anyhow , it is none of our business , is not it ?
yeah , china is developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
great . i can ring you up over here . it comes to $ 87 . 04 .
i suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer is account .
ok . please fill in this form and label it .
fine . will you work out the details , please ?
do not get all worked up over him . he is probably harmless .
that will be fine .
when you buy a model t , you cannot expect a warranty .
i can understand . i was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and did not tell my son .
one more thing . could you give me the names of the people you will be travelling with ?
we make deliveries only for bulk buying .
could i speak to diana curzon ?
ok , mr . coffee connoisseur , so what is the next step in the coffee-making process ?
what is the salary while on probation ?
what did you say to your boss ?
that is highway robbery .

well , i think you will like the mangoes .
ok . how much do you want to bet on this game ?
thank you . have a nice day .
what is your proposal ?
thanks . what shall i do then ?
what advantages does it have ?
my family loves spicy food . we often eat chinese , thai , indian , or mexican food when we are in the mood for spice .
ok , i will go to your office at that time .
ok , i will wait for you at 7pm at home . anything else ?
i think that i would enjoy the position but there is not a lot of creativity involved .
yes . i love it , too .
i have noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at peking university . will you please tell me something about your related courses ?
could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?
could you take it to that counter , please ?
what do you mean ?
i wonder why not . we could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections .
oh , i have not decided what i am going to do yet .
yes , my customers have started to complain too !
really ? look at the toe of this shoe . it is worn out .
ok . our check-in time is after 12: 00 . and see you tomorrow .
most of the things were household appliance . you know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it is an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home .
it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there .
i am sorry , but mr . johnson is out at the moment . can i take a message ?
it is probably jet lag .
well , i do not have an ethernet port . my computer runs entirely on wireless service .
$ 520 a month ? we do not often have apartments as inexpensive as that . we have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on seventh avenue . it is near the station .
do you know about our school ?
no upgrade of any kind . and where might you be going ?
what is your greatest accomplishment ?
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away , yi-jun !
listen , john . i understand that you are such an excellent student and i know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ?
i am going to put it here , in front of the window .
what are you not good at ?
i can not wait for buying his cd now .
only about 5 minutes .
in an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc .

what is the purpose for this check ? would you like to know its repayment capacity ?
how do i go about that ?
the bus ride is only thirty minutes or so .
oh , i did not know that .
but our order this time is very large . to open an l c for such a large amount at a bank is costly . can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?
no . i am sure about that .
it is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . and we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field .
looks like it . you need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
what kind of sports ?
i know what you are talking about . the performance evaluation process starts from the day we are hired . there is no surprise during the actual review .
no one in the family expected to get a dime from him . it was quite a surprise .
ok , i will fill out the form and come right back .
yeah , it sure would .
this fits me well , how much is it ?
it was good . i brough lunch from home today .
we need to work is because we need money to live . we need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . we need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . and work can also help us feel that we are useful .
no , i am not asking for money , i am asking for your advice .
for crying out loud ... how fast are we losing money ?
small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ?
you have drunk everything , sir ?

it is at the park up the street .
ok . i get it . i am getting back into bed ...

as you know , we are in a very special time . this is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
sure . we just got some . they are upto-date .
well , what is the problem then ?
do not you think in that case , there would not be so much stealing ?
ok . i just want to read the comics .
she wished good luck to you .
where is wort street , please ?
how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ?
yes , here you are . would you care to order now , sir ?
sure ! you just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back .
what are the benefits of e-commerce ?
sounds like a good idea . will we have a new slogan ?
oh , why did not you say it is an emergency ? here , fill out this form and take a seat . i will send you in next . you do not have insurance ?
play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste .
you are making me a believer .
it is 75 dollars plus tax .
yes , we do . that one comes in green blue and red .
i would like to get a double cheeseburger .
i thought the starting salary is too low .
not too bad , thanks . and you ?
how do you do , miss chen ? i am song mei .
thank you very much .
that is right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it is just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
how about afternoon ?
yes , i do . blue cross .
i am on time today
my wife did not like it !
how do you do , mr . wu ? welcome .
what is more , it is not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
that is exciting , man .
new york times . i read it everyday .
but mark is birthday is in april so i need to think about his present soon .
i think that is a good idea . you know i got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . he is an expert in organizational comunication . he does not come cheap , but he is an expert in this field . maybe he could help get things on track .
why do you choose our company ?
it is nice . i arrived safely .
yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously .
i have arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . can you make the reservation a little earlier ? if we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch .
you miss me , do not you ?
i see . may i have your name and phone number ?
yeah , i am glad that we did not have to wait long . i am starving !
but you will miss your good chance . i am so sorry

thank you for hiring me . i am very proud to be employed by your firm .
i guess so . what else can we do ? you cannot stay in the heat for long .
do not worry . i will buy a new necklace as same as the old one .
good morning . i am interested in antiques . do you have any ?
what will your major be ?
that is a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he is better trained to handle these sorts of things .
where do i get it ?
in seoul . but the company has operations in over fifty countries and thirty factories all over the world .
so , what do you think about the place ? are you glad that you moved in ?
i like taking photos out of doors .
it certainly was a great party . it is a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here .
i do not really feel like a walk .
sounds interesting . where did you get the idea ?
she is a real turn-on , alright ?
we are sure we will . and welcome to our corporation next year . we are expecting you .
you sound exhausted . maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . she can also help you do some household chores , and run so
no ! five minutes i promise !
thank youse much for all your help .
as a matter of fact , he has not been feeling too well .
leave me alone .
yes , here is your reservation . you have a standard room reserved for two nights . is that right ?
oh , penny , i am leonard , glad to meet you .
is it very cold in winter ?
you know , sometimes i cannot feel my ears and fingers .
it is a lot nicer , and i really like it better .
you cannot go any lower than that ?
no problem . the professional english course is just english for accounting . moreover , as you know , the atlantic trading company is a sino-australian joint venture . when i served part-time there , i became well acquainted with accounting operated in english .
we have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
yes , he knows i am coming . our meeting is set for 2 of the clock .
me , too . now let is make a list for what we need to with us .
i do not think so . i get so nervous talking to girls . i always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . besides , she is way out of my league .
glad to meet you . would you mind if i ask you some questions ?
i have to see a sample . bring me one this week , please .
i cannot believe that .
as the department i am applying for is expanding , i would like to contribute by effort .
thank you . can i meet my colleagues ?
yeah , how about your maths teacher ?
come on ! three is a crowd !
i have looked over your resume , ms . jane . i see you have already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ?
can i get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office is fault ?
that is what we thought , sir . that is what the news reported . but there was one little mudslide in our district too . right above our site .
40 miles per hour .
ah , i can smell jealousy in the air .
all right , now please sign the back of the card .
great ! now , when can i go down there and use the stations ?
it is ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient .
about david , no , i did not hear anything .
what did they take ?
of course . the warranty period is one year .
where are you going to find one ?
do you have clubs ?
did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ?
sure . hey , i am sorry , but i have got to get going .
no , i will call the attendants at the gate to tell them that you are on your way .
shall i see you on friday morning ?
run around the track . in the morning i run for an hour , and in the afternoon i run around the building .
i am going on trial .
that is absolutely wrong ! i was out exploring the city monday night .
here you are .
no , the gym is free to guests . take your room key , however , so you can get in .
well , i can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest .
why is that ?
that is very respectable , but i could never live with my parents . i usually only see them at our christmas celebration and that is enough !
what kind of candy do you want ?
this gift is the best for a man who has everything .
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
have a nice holiday !
okay . the sooner the better .
should we call the olsen is and ask them if they want to join us ?
thank you . that is enough .
what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great , but was quite strong .
of course . what do you want me to do , mom ?
since it is , i need a haircut with shampoo .
no , i do not mind . i just do not know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room .
ok . i will call you saturday morning .
yes . it was very cold and windy . we wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm .
this way , please . here they are . they are all handmade .
surely of course .
not at all .
you are not in a position to question my vision or my statement !
oh , melanie , you are a life saver , thank you !
football ? sounds dangerous . maybe i will just be a cheerleader .
pan american airlines . flight 282 .
good . well , mr . white , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery .
my husband is parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
that would be great ! thanks a lot !
and do not forget mary , tom is twin sister . it is her birthday , too .
i am afraid not .
i have been at the job i now have for 2 years , and i have been with the company for 6 years total .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
of course it does . does not every new phone include a camera these days ?
you could say so . i will work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise .
that is all . here is your bank card , and here is the certificate of deposit . bring your bank card with you every time you come to deposit or withdraw money .
well , that depends . when is it ?
i have a few questions about the free membership .
why ? did not you say that they were milestones ?
pick-up lines do not work !
yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill .
i just insert my debit card into the machine .
ok . where ?
what is the soup of the day ?
sure . the total comes to twelve dollars and eighty cents .
first i want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information .
the fruit basket was great . i need a few more apples , please .
football . it is a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and i also enjoying the team spirit of football .
do you think i will forget to do it ?
well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around .
did your boat float down the river ?
okay , let is go !
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
thank you , mr . jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . the subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . i plan to say a few words about the current situation in the middle east and how it affects world economy . i would like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . i have divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . my presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . we will stop for lunch at 12 .
i have it already .
it is beautiful ! look , there are so many birds around it .
did you get a good look at them ?
i will try .
let me see . it is 9
i would just like a trim , and do not cut it too short .
i will see what i have . what do you need it for ?
let me pay for it .
their interest rates are usually quite high . it is a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
that is right . all my guests , attention please . we will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . and next spot will be the moon reflected in three pools .
i am returning a book .
really ? i am so sorry i bothered you . i will try again .
i apologize for this mess . they ' ve got me handling so many projects , and it is hard to keep things organized .
he is the poor kid is father .
yes , but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i should not have got angry .
what kind of work are you doing now ?
ok . we will try some .
i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
what is the english for hongtao , leitao , meihua and fangpian ?
throughout the interview you should maintain patience .
spring will come soon . and we will have some pleasant weather then .
how about tango ?
what is it about ?
it will begin at five thirty .
maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down .
in what way ?
let is go there for lunch ! i am up for an adventure !
maybe that is why i could not find it . all the documents on nova are filed under ' v ' .
do you have an appointment ?
the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that is definitely the lowest we can go .
yes . i have a lot of experience in that . i have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university .
well , can i start you off with some cocktails while you are looking over the menu ?
from code 513 , 432-6748 .
no problem . i can deal with it well .
fine , i will bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on thursday .
i am not sure , perhaps around 8 pm .
no , i will stay here at the booth . i ate earlier . are you going to the chinese restaurant ?
hmm ... you are right . well , i guess ' terminator ' is an exception to the rule .
just leave the stuff by the curb . the company will send a guy out next month to give you the bill .
i also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . can i fetch it the day after tomorrow ? it is urgent .
sure . thank you for saying that . actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . i wrote them in the past two months .
how do you know her ?
yes , i have seen those signs .
you would better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next september ...
i am a defender . it is a lot of fun . you do not have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
ok . how does seven of the clock this evening sound ?
oh , we have many kinds . do you like this design .
no . but she taught me last term . how long have you been here ?
maybe you could hire me on trial , if i am not qualified for this position , you can let me go .
which season do you like best ?
you may take a no . 34 bus . and the subway can also take you there .
no , not at all . i was on the swimming team in high school . and i would like to do some weight training . they have decent equipment at that gym .
how much money are you going to transfer today ?
oh , i am fine .
could you please get him on the phone ?
yes , they are .
i love to dance the fast music .
oh , yes . madam , we will come right away then . your room number and your name , please ?
fine , i will take a taxi .
i buy a computer magazine every month . it keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments .
that is great ! thank you very much .
ever since i was a young girl , i have been clever with my hands . i have always enjoyed doing detailed work . if i could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , i would be happy .
any other ideas ?
you must have spent much time on the project .
sir , when i deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge .
wait , will i have five insurances and one fund ?
alright , let is go .
certainly . there will be a good chance of that if you work for this company . not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . any questions ?
yes , could you cash these travaler is check for me , please ?
pretty good , thanks . i am going to see my uncle .
here is your ticket and change , sir .
two weeks and i would like to go abroad .
you should easily be able to find a job with that major .
it also helps that i have strong team members , such as yourself . you really know your stuff !
i want to fetch them in 3 days .
really ? have you ever been there ?
very well , thank you .
yes , i am . that is right .
do you want to bet ?
can i stop by ?
oh , i have forgotten to tell you . the party is held every other week . and every family gives their own performance each time .
oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ?
we do have a storage space for your bags . there is a small charge , plus a deposit .
that is great !
nothing particular . but , ...
could i ask you some questions ?
yes , i will .
well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace .
i am very sorry for any inconvenience i have caused you .
i sometimes use traveller is cheques , but sometimes i travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash .
there are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting .
what you are paying for , ma'am , are the ingredients . it is a very high quality product .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ?
lucky number . find its location now .
would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?
you are welcome . please press that button if you need any help .
do not worry about that . your english seems very good . and our instruction manuals are very clearly written . it is easy !
i think that is a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
i am afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
i usually get a lot of information on the computer and use e-mail to send messages to my friends .
you are welcome .
certainly . does she have your number ?
asking her father in front of her . how do you think she will react ?
sorry , i just worried about him . you know , he should be here an hour ago .
you are so old-fashioned . that is what people used to think about people from another country !
i know they are not good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty .
yes , i am really weak in maps , i did poorly in high school .
i know ! i hate it ! but i am taking this crash course in math .
thanks . i will be sitting over there .
of course . they will be happy you asked about them .
i need to make an appointment with you today .
where do we begin ?
did you lose any weight ?
you are welcome .
good idea . thanks a billion .
what is playing at the century fox ?
is not that the chick flick with kate hudson and owen wilson ?
that sounds reasonable . let me think it over . and i will call your back to make reservation .
that is nice . what do they have you doing over there ?
a picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .
the ticket was for parking in the red zone .
maybe they know they should not run a red light , but when they are driving they do not pay enough attention to traffic lights .
right , but that is where my heart is . but you are right , now there are only 14 living at home .
this is really exciting movie . lets go to this one .
all is best now , is not it ?
i agree . buses bounce too much . after two or three hours , you feel too tired .
what about supply of parts to the production line ?
i know . i still have not heard from her . the good thing is that i am so angry with her that i do not feel sad about not having her around .
the myoma is very popular . there will be a lot of people .
me , either ! who decides how much money we get ?
that is no problem . do you offer any other consulting services ?
thank you very much for your evaluation . i also like this job very much .
okay , more relaxed . got it . hey , sally , what is up ? it is tracy here , just .

business is booming . i understand you want to meet up with me next week . how is your schedule look ?
oh , thank you . you are so sweet !
oh yes . men , women , and children shake hands all the time .
oh , i prefer it loose
what did you see ?
i have been really busy . how is everything ?
see you later .
you have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you .
well , that is cool .
well , it does have a lot of girls in it .
it does not matter .
i am not sure , but in the meantime we will freeze these charges .
we are going to the bookshop . would you like to join us ?
what time will you be back ?
i am the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation . we spent two days in the mountains .
thanks a lot .
how he manages to do that is always a mystery to me .
but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too .
that sounds good . last year i paid $ 30 .
great , i will see you then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
true . but i think it is worth it . when you get old , you want to be healthy and active .
i think we will need more time than the schedule gives us .
what is more , he said i was the hardest working person in the office !
what did you buy ?
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance .
ok , 400 yuan please .
okay . does this car have a warranty ?
most sichuan dishes are spicy and hot . they taste differently .
yes . i tried skiing on grass before . not very good at it , though .
can i do anything else for you ?
all right . say cheese !
i went there to check for problems with the home , so you are not surprised when you move in .
let is go together .
did they accept the counter-offer ?
well , as i mentioned before , i think i am easy-going . i enjoy working and talking with people and i am a responsible person .
you are right . but if i get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again .
oh , yes . my friend told me the hotel was near the central railway station .
have you been on the bus for a while ?
i know , but remember to meet in a public place and do not give out your personal information .
i am dead tired and i cannot walk any further .
that is a good question . you know i love hip hop , so maybe we can play some vanilla ice songs .
is it really worth paying for ?
thank you . is there any mail for me ?
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
no , but this is an emergency ! please !
i am looking for a growth opportunity , which i feel is not available at my current employer . in terms of skills , i am microsoft certified in windows xp and several other operating systems .
i know a good place to hire bikes if you want .
who are you favourite authors ?
we have been together for a year and usually , people who have been together a year , take their vacation together .
you are a smart girl !
yes , i want to go out . would you like to come ?
it is a pleasure to meet you , miss green .
it is so small that i did not notice it .
perhaps the food was bad .
well , it is an automatic camera . you just press the button .
yes , i am , and i am so excited .
he is 21 . how old is james ?
as a matter of fact , i am from taiwan .
it looks that way . that is probably why the door was not locked when we came in .
you will not get anywhere that way . you are the one who needs to practice english , so you should make the first move . besides , most american students are really friendly and outgoing . they will be glad to talk to you .
well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . we use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine .
wow ! you are really working up a storm !
yeah , you seem to like those styles .
i just cannot stand it . it is really gross in here ! there is a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . so i cleaned it !
yeah . it is the very latest in digital video cameras .
that is fate .
that is right .
i use short messages quite a lot . if it is not too complicated i will send a short message , which can save much phone charge .
did she accept it ?
sorry , i never go out on saturday evening . i always watch football on saturday evening .
superman is not afraid of any danger .
via kiang . i would like to leave on may 5th .
then your salary must be high .
look closely at the five men in this line-up .
but the bank should be closed so we should not to be able to get any money .
really , it is so beautiful .
the movie starts at eight of the clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
i know ! i do not get them at all . but wait , is not ' terminator ' a sci-fi movie ?
the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . do you know all about them ?
well , maybe we will go to ask mr . johnson . he has the final say .
how would your coworkers describe you ?
thx . bye for now . kisssssssssss .
you have come to the right store . we have got a beautiful and wide selection of necklaces for you to choose from .
i am going to the golden hotel .
i really want it to rain today .
all i had was a sandwich , chips , and soda .
hold on please , i will check for you . flight gb152 takes off every day at 13
and what about the number of people on the streets ?
so what happened ?
maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . let me check my mail-box again .
i cannot keep up with the game . the players play so quickly that i can hardly see what they are doing .
that is unavoidable , but think , how would you keep up to date without television ?
yes , i do . everyone is really friendly . sometimes , i wish i worked outdoors more , especially during the summer .
no , i have not .
well , we can do nothing about it .
i am not sure . i was thinking of making a vegetable .
good . you scared me .
okay , anything else i can get you ?
are you planning on having someone take notes for you ?
what kind of shoes ?
you must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college .
i hope i could get promoted some day . tell me about your experience , ok ?
how was your game today ?
i have never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like i am going to need to make a claim .
stop talking like my mother . that is what she keeps saying .
do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use ?
sure . should i wash or dry ?
i stayed home because i was not feeling well .
i am glad you could come to see us off . i have enjoyed your interpreting . you have done a wonderful job . i hope you be my interpreter again next time i am here .
hey , you can dance to rap music !
yes , i do . it is ready and waiting in my account .
sure , i can take you there actually .
thank you for your help .
coke please . oh , no , a cup of hot chocolate will be fine .
i think with international business a language would be appropriate .
in short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .
we have to send it to landfill . it is very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we are planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste .
you are sounding like we are already married .
well , may i leave a message ?
sure , it is the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . good luck !
i will let you break the balls this time .
no , why ?
thank you very much , doctor .
i want a single room with ocean view . do you have one ?
i am looking forward to seeing you again . take care .
the headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . few other stories made the front pages .
take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . he will pay you for them . are you going today ?
yeah ! do all these people work in the company ? everyone and their dog is here !
i know where the c building is .
what about a boa constrictor ?
yes , okay .
here is your bill , sir . could you please check it ?
for fun . it serves as a shared topic to them . while they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . when it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . but if there is not any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual .
sure , anytime .
oh , listen , i cannot even remember . ok , on my birthday , i wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ...
yes , the swimming pool is right behind the building . walk out of the door and you will see it .
oh my god . please save her life .
ok . is there a chinese restaurant ?
i got it from the cafeteria .
i am off this friday .
what is its name ?
my name is james .
thank you very much . mr . george . as a newcomer , i understand that you have your consideration and i am satisfied with the raise .
milk , please .
no . no need for admission . i will give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . then i will give you a prescription . the pink tablets are used for his fever . when his temperature is over 38 c , give him one tablet . the other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . the white liquid is for the cold . give the baby plenty of water to drink .
the pleasure is mine . it is nice talking with you . good-bye , mr . owens .
do not worry . i believe you are just not agreeing with the local climate . i will get you some medicine . you will be alright after a good rest .
we might get a gold medal in the sailing too . our team put in a lot of practice .
me too . send you a kiss ...
i am absolutely useless at cooking !
when i first moved in , i walked everywhere . but within a week , i had my purse stolen just a block away from the police station ! now , i always take public transportation .
they are four yuan per kilo .
i will just use the atm .
i do not care the brand as long as it works well .
we offer various types of transportation . perhaps you would like to upgrade to a private vehicle ?
have you traveled by air before ?
really ? tell me without delay .
i have been away on holidays for sometime .
what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen .
i am buckled up . what is next ?
i am fond of history books .
all of his works have been translated into english . i recommend you to read one or two works of his . you will get a general glimpse into chinese kung fu culture . when you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .
because he beat me first when i tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .

we will be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it is for payroll .
i do not know how old he is though .
why do not you just continue going to pcc ?
right . and that would be a total giga-bummer .
certainly , which color do you want to dye it ?
oh , there are many chinese antique stores . they get paintings , too . do you get interested in them ?
you do allow pets , do not you ?
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
in what department do you wish to work if we hire you ?
of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet .
no , thanks . we have made a reservation before .
sure , but you must verify that first and do not easily make a promise .
you have two meetings today . one is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . after the meeting , you will have dinner with mr . brown at the chinese restaurant in sister hotel .
lots of people are ill at the moment .

yes . we usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers .
you need not always do that . why do not you pat them on the back occasionally ?
it means ' telegraphic transfer ' . so , if you use this way it is fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world .
i like neither .
no , you cannot waste your time wandering around . if you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam if you want a job that needs working

yes . only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it .
i am sorry to hear that .
i feel it is rather dry here
i know you did not .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . but , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
she likes to complain about her macho husband and her bambinos , but she loves them all dearly .
it is a very beautiful place in southwest china .
no , this is the medicine for the stomach .
i am sure she knew you loved her . did she pass away in the hospital ?

when i asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . so i took it out on him by telling him what i thought .
wait until you see what happens next ! the bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . let is go over and watch .

thank you , but i prefer the fish .
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !

yes , i can get it for you but i need to go back inside the bank .
is there any way that you can fix my schedule ?
oh , dear , well , it looks like we have a few rooms available , can i put you into a room on the 17th floor ? it has a balcony and it does not face the highway .
ok . i will get it for you .
that is not the same thing . if you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
do not bother .
no , there are only some vases .
you are right . would you please show me some embroidery ? i also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry .
it is all the same to me .
it is going to be a problem when my water bill comes .
that is everything .
i do not find it very exciting .
what will happen if i do not maintain that ?
forty faulty instruments means that 4 are not up to the standard . you should compensate us for 4 of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
poor mary ! she really liked him .
yes , of course .
why cannot i call someone to fix it today ?
is there anything i can do ?
ah yes , i remember now .
that is free .
if everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they could not go , so i think it should be ok ?
yes . i am sure he will . i will take it .
hold on a minute , please .
no , i have not . is the food good there ?
usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time .
i am throwing a party next saturday .
well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . you are also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports .
yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card .
rudeness . you are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you should not throw yourself into the chair like you are loading heavy baggage .
it is nothing to get upset about .
i have to go now . i do not want to be late .
did you panic at the time ?
we can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . we also provide workshops .
my wife , my daughter and i .

i like company .
ok ... actually , i do not mind eating peas and carrots , buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower .

i am okay . what are you doing these days ?

i have no idea . i have no appetite .
you are right , it is a low percentage . also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . it is quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings .
it has stopped snowing , but it is even colder .
ok , ok . on one condition .
make it tighter . i want the blood stopped . then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk .

just say the word , sir .
i would like the extra lean .
he told me to stay in bed for ten days .
yes , it is reasonably fast but it certainly is not cheap . fares have gone up25 .
most people are not very politically aware . they often do not understand the issues fully .
i think you should make some preparations . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . what is more , try to avoid a too causal style .
probably . the new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek . one of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company .
my room number is 1010 and the name is ted black .
you should probably call the it department and have them check your computer for virus .
here you go .
that must have been horrible . did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ?
at two thirty .
honey , just turn down the stove .
no , it is quite simple . when you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off .
fine . thank you very much .
what a lucky man .
i would prefer mornings .
me too . i will write to you once i get settled . but i have so much to do . you might have to wait a while . but i really will write to you . i love to write letters . i think it is more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .
it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? because they have got character ?

it was a piece of cake .

anything strang about that ?
when we say your prices are much too high , we do not mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . if we are to place an order with you . i think a discount of about 15 would be sufficient .
there should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers
uh ... yes . turn right , then take the second turning on your left .
do you have a brand preference for anything ?
what are the charges you are referring to ?
it would not be full right now , would it ?

well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !

i would not say so .
sounds good . what time do you want me to come ?
how much is it , then ?
where should i go ?
i am sorry we cannot handle the price you offered .
i think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . if they have related services , they may be willing to help us out .
you have got it .
you are right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . i will keep you informed .
that is $ 1825 .
i kind of want pizza .

i will measure you ... you take size 6 . what colour hat would you like ?
how long will you be staying ?
for a week or so .
there are other things i need to take care of .

eat less and exercise more . do not eat too much sweet food .
ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you would better change 2,000 $ to swiss francs .

yy is ? that place is boring . how about xara is ? it is real classy , and they keep the place spin and span .
great work . i am off for the weekend ! see you on monday .
ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
and after church they come here for lunch ?
i am sorry . but at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started .
i think that is the reason why princess diana is hair style became so popular .
pretty well . i do not know if i will get the promotion or not , but i feel good about it .
will that be all ?
what do you mean ? these are the washing machines . those big things over there are the dryers .
okay . i will be back in a minute with your drink and salad .

why ? i have stayed for 3 nights .
i finished it all .
what do you mean , mr . smith ? you said to make it brief .
by the way , can i open a checking account too ?
when did you buy your new computer ?
how long ago did you do that ?
yes , sure . to be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . however , we have to if it is necessary for our company . i would do that if it is the call of duty .
yes , here you are .
no problem . how many are you thinking about ?
then , you would better go to the medical department . but first , you should fill in the registration card and the registration fee is one yuan .
i see . by the way , what if i forget to cash my money when the maturity comes ?
i cannot agree more . that is why i only do street shopping .

oh , no . as a matter of fact , i have not danced for a long time .
oh , it must be very precious . is it breakable ?
i would like to see some coats . would you recommend me some of them ?
is that a return journey or just one-way ?
yeah . i turned around and started to move out . just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! i may sacrifice a little . let is fix it sixty-five ! cannot be cheaper . '
three thousand ! that is almost too good to be true . did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?
me too . recently , i have made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i do not know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be .

what are the dates , sir ?
i surely know that . do not forget that i am a regular customer here .
my aunts studied in the american universities . they say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your english . that is what they learn here in america .
it is really healthy to eat when you bake it .
do not do it ! if you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed .
how many rooms do you need in the flat ?
we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . but our suggestion to you , mr . bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
yes , i know . i think honda is the most reliable car on the road . i would never change to anything else . the honda i have now almost never has service problems . it runs smooth as silk .
i am ready when you are , sir .

i braked as hard as i could .
she is not bad . she is a bit bossy , but i am sure i will get used to her .

yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country .
that happens a lot in non-english speaking countries .
i know , that is the problem . he cannot find any customers . it is a pity , really , because his products are very good . oh , that reminds me . did i tell you about my new laptop ?

sure . the twenty-ninth is out . i will be out of the office all day at a seminar . either the twenty-eighth or the thirtieth is fine .
mr . brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . if we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .

that is right . now try on this one . it is size 41 .

how about 50 yuan ?

you know that i care for you . i , i am proud of you .
that would be great .
you know , today i asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . it is a rule i made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they do not understand me . the funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .
the reason i have called this meeting is to review a proposal we have received from our international division in hong kong . the agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by mr . black . second , an analysis by ms . nielson . finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal .

we need to work is because we need money to live . we need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . we need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . and work can also help us feel that we are useful .
i want to immigrate to the states because my daughter works and lives there .
really ? i like rainy days . the moisture in the air is good for my skin .
my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .
okay . how much do you want me to get ? a gallon ?
is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
it is very good . how do you make it ?

yes , five to six weeks .
let me get that package .
nearby , on the banks of the thames , there is the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain .
oh , so you are a teacher .
i want to return this video .
not really , so long as you follow all the regulations .
wait a moment , mom .
you see i do business on a commission basis . a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . even 2 or 3 would help .
well i had several tests and an oral presentation this week so i did not get a chance to memorize the second page , but i think i mastered the tricky section .
you are quite right .
that is good . it is good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while .
i am sorry . i will not do it again .
i have passed the cet - 4 and 6 . as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing .
yes , i would like to have this parcel delivered to shanghai .
yes , please . i am actually returning her call . so perhaps you could tell her that i called .
and sorry . i cannot find the price . how much is it ?
i am afraid not . every coin has two sides . i think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction .
well , can i put something in this handbag ?
sure ! right now , i would even eat hamburger !
hello , this is catherine . i am calling about the appointment with mr . liu for this afternoon . something has just come up . i am afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled . i am very sorry about the change .
what sports do you like best ?
yes . bring me a bath towel as well .
it must be very demanding .
we work in teams . there are about four to six people in each team . i am training to be a team leader . each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce . we are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs . i like that . it stops the work getting boring .
public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere .
i see . will it be doubled for the round trip ?
i feel dizzy .
come in , please .
there should not be any long lines , sir .
what have you done ?
that is no problem . there are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . which service would you like ?
only 2 dollars and 25 cents .
it sounds good . i will bring the papers i am working on .
what do you mean ?
you were scared , too ? i dared not tell you my feeling when i heard that . i almost got fainted .
well , i remember walking pass the baker shop .
i am sure it will be . it is been good so far this weekend .
you must enjoy yourself .
but he took some newspaper away without paying .
it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth .
i am interested in switching fields .
would you like some help with the food ?
if everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there are any objections or corrections , let me know . next week , we can cast the final approval .
would you please let me know when we get there ?
he is outgoing and honest , but sometimes he is a bit conservative .
he got the money and tried to leave .
i have a time deposit here and i would like to get the money now .
i am a little nervous . i have never flown before .
yes , we are .
yes . what can i do for you ?
i got it . then i should mention my educating background and working experience , should i ?
i told you that we want first-class goods . so the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . do you remember those details ?
your appetite is good .
i hear that he is quitting .
you might lose the file you were working on , but do not worry , the help desk can restore it . when did you last take a backup ?
i see . please call us again for any further reservation . thanks for calling us .
okay , thanks very much .
you are pretending !
it is ten cents a copy , sir .
do you enjoy work here ?
what about the twill ? it washes well and will not lose shape .
then one hard seat , please .
i usually go to see a live band about twice a month . what about you ?
i would like to return this book .
nothing . i mean , do not bring anything . it is not necessary .
see you borrow .
i did , too . come and visit us again , will you ?
um , let me see . hmm . this antique tea set here is gorgeous .
do you want me to check the tires ?
how old is she ?
i am not exactly prepared right now . how about i go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ?
i have worked here for two years . and i want to do something different .
at school , we sometimes have chinese food for lunch .
but it is none of our business .
would friday morning be alright ?
ok . i will wait until you have had your fun , if that is what you want .
oh , i did not know you can play the violin . do you still play .
yes , of course . most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . another thing is that most travelers to the uk tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . this age group is less adventurous they like good hotels , and have money to spend . they kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . they are not into mountain climbing in wales or anything .
but my salary will be 1100 dollars a month . will you pay me that much for the first month ? because , i mean , i will not be working so many hours .
about 7 thirty .
yes of course . you can see the whole city on the bus . it is cheap as well as efficient .
what should i do then ?
it sounds a good idea . let is go .
thank you . i want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others .
yes . they are over there .
no . i do not . please .
do not underestimate his taste . i do not think he would like it .
thanks . i can wait here .
that is a great relief . i was worried about him .
no wonder you like the class so much .
it is $ 20 . if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
cool . thanks . jimmy brings may a glass of orange juice .
oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management .
yes , it is $ 167 .
that should make things perfectly simple , then . actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post .
oh , so i do not sign the contract today . is that right ?
hi , this is maria . is that shirley ?
how about tomorrow at 11 of the clock ?
i feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly .
absolutely . with your expertise and experience , you are clearly working below your pay grade .
you need to invest in some good advertising . you have to know where your potential customers are and target them . it is no good trying to sell computer games to older people . the market is too small .
i am sorry to hear that . i will have to examine you .
very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one is health .
yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . but for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' .
there is branch on new street . walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . then turn right at the traffic lights .
great . i will call and make reservations .
you have not thought about it ?
well , it was my car .
i have heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
but watch this ... it bends upwards , just like dilbert is tie . there is a wire inside .
freelance , hmm . how do you think she will manage in an office environment ?
yes , but he was supposed to be back by now .
that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we would like to see it before making a final decision .
4: 00 p.m ..
sure . we tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems .
how do you spell your family name ?
thank you . i am glad we have come to an agreement at last .
yeah i got a club card . here you go .
i m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
yes , sir . what would you like ?
fine , thanks . i am having several friends over for dinner this saturday . and i was wondering if you have the time to join us .
first you should have a salutation , which can be the company is or a person is name .
anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . we have done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . it would help me greatly , if you could accept d a or d p . it makes no difference to you , but it does to me .
ok , we will be expecting you at 11: 30 then . see you then .
no , right here in the parking lot . it was parked right here in your space . the left rearview mirror was smashed .
yes , that is fine . now when you finish these , i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
ok . i will bring it for you .
may i have his office phone number please ?
i cannot have the heart to do that .
nothing really , why , what is up ?

well , i do not like it , but i guess i do not have any choice .
well , this is my baggage claim tag . can you get my baggage now ?
they always eat spaghetti and drink wine , do not they ?
what is your email address ? i will add you to my contacts list .
did you bring that from home ?
right at the bridge ?
my name is ron kollwitz .
it was at the beginning . you just need to keep it up .
oh , no . we just did it last week .
no , i have been here for six months .
jump in , i will give you a ride .
can i get the ticket here ?
i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish a job and it turned out just as i would planned .
i understand . and according to the terms on the contract , i am happy to accept this job . i look forward to it .
your credit is fine , sir . now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ?
i have got a few classical music cd is . i should follow your lead and increase my brian power .
i agree . and some cartoons are entertaining even for adults .
you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , is not that strict ?
jack and stephanie .
friday is great .
you are the leading company in the computer industry .
yes , i was , officer .
you eat too much junk food . that sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol .
these shoes are great ! what is the price of this ?
well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
i am fine , thank you .
do you have any family here ?
well , i guess you will meet many people in this field . so do not forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase .
that is great . we should visit him some time .
yes i am . nice to meet you , jack .
please fill out this form , please .
no , and i do not usually get a lot of stomachaches .
thank you so much .
if you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ?
it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . how is it that we are such good friends ?
this is one of my favorite items .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .
i have been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . besides , i grew up in a city in the northeast . i have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales .
mr and mrs ryefield , that is r-y-e-f-i-e-l-d .
yes , mr . emory . thank you .
if you have any problem in your work , let me know .
what kind would you like ?
what makes you say that ?
no , but i got a pay rise of 5 and a hours for all the hard work i have put in recently . i think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way .
am i standing the right way ?
it is complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i cannot continue working for a company that may let me go .
how do you do ? mr . barker .
what a large child !
it is really elegant and it fits you really well .
that is a good idea . i think i will join you .
well , we are sorry to hear that . may i have your name and room number ? we will deal with the matter right now .
it is 671029 , my birthday . silly to choose such a simple one , i suppose !

oh , gag me ! she is totally gross !
that is good to hear . she is usually full of vein and vigor .

thank you . now they are playing a rumba . would you have a try ?
would you mind changing the position or working place you have applied for ?
what happened before ?
yes , it is my girlfriend is birthday today and she loves chocolate .
actually , i could use some help . thank you so much .
but a chinese person would never order that .
well , i need the display monitor . but tom can set that up for me on wednesday . i will need you to help with everything else .
may i see your identification , please , sir ?
do not mention it . do not forget to take your daughter along next time .
how many countries have been affected ?
let me give you your confirmation number . it is 7576385 . i will repeat that , 7576385 . thank you for choosing san felice hotel and have a nice day . goodbye .
yes , i would like to make reservation for tonight , a table for five , please .
get on the phone right now . it might not be too late .
oh great ! does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
it has to ! i have been studying every day , eight hours a day ! i do not know , but the school has a great success record .
no , any change . i want you to keep me as informed as you are . i need to know as much as you do . if you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it . tell me it is rumor , what it is based on and your opinion on how likely it is .
what was taken ?
thank you , linda . we would love you to come to our wedding .
you will get used to it gradually .
you come back here with me tomorrow , and it is my treat !

yes , let is get something to eat .
no . i would like to do something special for you on your birthday .
i was hoping you would have something on sale today .
mr . black has been getting a little around aside .
that is ok . but that must be costly .
that is a great idea . i am going to do the same .
two rows up on the right . we have various kinds of chocolates .
and the number in japan , please ?
very good . would you like anything else ?
i would love to see it .
that is absolutely incorrect ! i was out on the town monday night .
what ? beg your pardon .
yeah , they are my wife is heaven , but not mine . i always get lost in the supermarket .
your sister said you fainted three times during the injection .
fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw , please .
what are they ?
what kind do you have ?
just fill out an application .
do not worry about how many papers there are . we are going to look at them one at a time .
ok , that would be great .
yes , there have been a few problems recently . why do not you call the it department ?
you should do better later .
did not you have a crash ?
sounds interesting , but soccer does not really appeal to me .
i am not sure if i will be home later .
5,000 euros will be sufficient , thanks .
i will send you an invoice in the next few days . your order should be delivered before the end of the day on monday .
really ? how much is it ?
exactly , i overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , i guess . they were only three of us in the elevator , i felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them .
yes , g stands for general audiences , pg means parental guidance suggested , r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content .

boy oh , boy ! this is so cool . let is rock and roll !
i will cancel that check for you .
hi pete , how do you know my name ?
yes , they generally cost a little more .
then i can go to this appointed dealer , see what they have got and then make a decision ?
more often than not , the understatement is ' i am afraid it is time you leave ' .
ok , when and where did you last see it ?
oh yes . i have got it written down here . just a minute .
then let is go in .
then who will you meet tonight ?
what would you like to know , mr . green ?
thank you very much . i have been wondering here for almost half an hour .
yes , actually it is my second visit . i was there last october .
then what shall i do ?
here is my card , just give me a call if you are interested .
would you please follow me , please ?
very sorry that i have caused you so much trouble .
i wonder if i can use your bike .
that sounds just right to me . what was wrong with it ?
because that company is behavior is not in accordance with international law .
no , but the nurse at school says that i should have my blood pressure checked .
what am i supposed to do now ?
could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
gotcha ... ok . here they are .

i would like to speak to the ms . collins , please .
then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path .

once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon .
do you have any difficulties in doing business in china ? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
okay . bbs , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums .
not really , but i like watching .
that is it for today . thank you .
hmm . well , we have some alternatives , if you are interested .
right . it is very strong , just like alcohol . frank sips mao tai .
yes , but my notes are all nonsense . i cannot figure out what is important .
that was easy !
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown , as i spend most of my time at the office .
oh , not too bad , but i have got to stay in bed .
i think so . you can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive .
our company now has n ombudsman ?
i remember mom going with a lot of pepper for the meat .
i guess i am adventuresome , but then i am scared too .
come on in , please .
there might be a loose connection somewhere that is making the safety switch trip . check the settings on the trip-switch . if you cannot fix it yourself , call in an electrician .
ok , good luck to you .
oh , stop it ! you know you need vegetables . you will end up fat if you do not watch your diet , now .
is there a warranty ?
well , i guess so .
how can i have the good external expressions ?
is that right ?
yes , please .
well , everything seems to be just about ready . now all we need is snow . do you exchange the presents in the morning ?
what about a flight to paris ?
i would also like a bag of chips .
yes . a few days ago i have no right to get a driving licence . but now i get it .
on all our new cars , the standards include
maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans do not . you would have to soak it for 10 years .
no , thanks . i am just looking .
really ? i cannot believe you actually found an apartment in the ads .
not yet . i am hoping we will be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer .
why not ? there is not much time left . are you short of cash ?
ok , that is perfect , 70 is excellent , it will be a big help . thanks .
you are welcome .

oh , that is just too bad . i intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
i would like to rent a car with a good stereo .
yes , we are . what position are you looking for ?
the northern line is what you want .
i think that you have covered all the important points already . but if i have any questions later i will contact you .
weki , doctor . i went to a birthday party .
maybe . but it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . i am getting to like the game more and more .
anything strange about that ?
very well , thanks , i will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , i have been worked on in for six months , and i am so closed to end . i can feel it .
it is on the south wall of the store , in aisle a .
a single room with a bath and one double room facing the lake .
then i will tell folks the food is ready . come and get it ! i have always wanted to say that !
you need to get on the 261 . it goes all the way to sons .
hey , i am a pretty cool guy i will make friends . and i will have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . you know , like fencing or theater or something .
that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ?
i am so sorry . we ran out of filet mignon . may i suggest the porterhouse instead ?
can you tell me the calling number , please ?
i am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ?
what is up ? you look unhappy .
yeah , i have the same feeling . also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . but at a wholesale market , you never know whether w
you are allowed an additional two carry-on items .
hello . i would like to send 600 rib in cash to my daughter . how long will it take for her to receive the money ?
a specialist ? that is excellent , thanks .
i know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . after all , it is a sport . but do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?
no , that is the problem . though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . so , when he dies , the girls will have nothing .
what do you do ?
and the problem with jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . he is putting his heart into his stamp collection .
you will find the cereal by the breakfast foods .
is that right ?

hope to see you again . we will provide the best service .
oh , i like this music very much , let is tango .
where did you get that idea ?
where would you like to be located ?
what are you doing ? is anything wrong ?
do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ?
what ? why ? cannot you renew it ?
but i find japanese ones better .
let is hit the whirlpool for a bit . it will help me loosen up .
so what am i allowed to check out ?
i guess i would buy that ...
good morning , i have an appointment with mr . johnson at 10: 00
yeah , prices have really gone up the past couple of years .
i am sorry , sir . all the tickets have been sold out .
i think so .
certainly , a beer . here you are , sir .
i am going to need your library card .
your seat is three , in the third row , near the window .
if i were him , i would notbrazen it outby asking my parents for money .
yes , i was there as an english teacher .
yes , let is .
yes . the stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . you can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well .
well , with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob , chocolate hairstyle or bang . which do you prefer ?
do not you have a credit card ?
let is see . yes . you have got quite a high temperature .
dancing . the boys from the campus band have promised to play music for us .
i need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . i will quit then transfer to your company .
i can only spend $ 300 a month .
it is about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here is one that is about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it is on a small street , just off a main street .
they might actually win the game .
parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom .
i know . this is a really good bargain .
what time do you usually go to bed ?
oh , no . i am sure i made a reservation for a first-class ticket .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
it was my pleasure .
i would love to help if i can .
yes , 20 yuan for each .
it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . it happens all the time . no need to worry .
but you have not practised all that much .
anyhow , it is a long way to china , is not it ? and i think you must be very tired .
about 20 to 30 minutes .
i love rumba and waltz .
it is worth every penny of it .
i agree . maybe we can come back again next week .
when i traveled around your country , i bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . the jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . the gold was found in mountain steams .
yes , next march .
well , doctor ?
i am sorry , but no . we used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident .
i think you can go to visit the museum . it is worth seeing . you can go to the square some other time .
what should we buy ?
really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities .
it is not what i asked for .
a friendly one . i think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . an employee should feel she he can go to her his boss anytime with any kind of question .
i never knew that .
is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
what about the 3rd round ?
you are joking , right ? no wonder we have been tied up with this project . i know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they have found anything endangered on the site . are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ?
i am bob brown . but i cannot recall my account number .
an exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with .
yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account .
bottoms up ! by the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ?
more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . if your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
my friend needed me to help him .
yes and no . let me see if i can clarify that . the terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months .
i am not sure , i feel hot and cold .
oh , yeah . i am there !
ok , thank you .
ok , i will have it for a change .
credit card . the international credit card , i cannot find it anywhere .
that sounds good .
great . see you then .
sometimes it is good , sometimes it is bad . you have to like the furniture .
i do not think so . as the saying goes , a great oak needs deep roots . i am really interested in this job .
then go to bed and have a good sleep .
really , nothing big . i just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and i wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department .
i have been there . it is in the middle of the mountains . it is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian .
i see what you mean . that was pretty easy after all .
you are going to need your id to pay the ticket .
my little brother likes to play with him . he even gives him a bath every week .
you are flattering me .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
but when i pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . i always respect your food preferences .
oh , do you ? good .
you can use this . it has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . it has this lotion , as a gift attached .
how about this one ? it is our biggest 16 in diameter .
it should also be truthful and realistic . do not blindly blow your own horn .
well , compared with my wife , i am just a beginner .
this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying .
i cannot remember .
yes , my name is carol tiang . that is spelled j - i - a - n - g .
do you know if there is a convenience store around here ?
are you saying we do not have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? jane , you know i really do not like our teacher all that much . he gives far too much homework . he criticizes me in front of everyone all the time .
i do not understand . we were getting along so well .
no , really , i think you would like it . i adapted to it right off the bat .
it is said that the father is will caused the dissension among the two brothers .
i am glad to inform you that you are expected to come for an interview in our head office tomorrow .
is there anything valuable in it ?
well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful .
thanks a lot .
well , let is go to the marathon tomorrow then ! we can just stand by the side of the road .
tom ... you are her boss , you down . of course , she is helpful to you .
in this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . if you take any leaves , we will deduct money from your salary .
you can ask her out for drinks after work .
very well . what about you ?
ok . do you want to order something else ?
the registration office . did you bring your records with you ?
in this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?
an after i buy the ticket , where should i go ?
first i was late for school this morning , and now i broke your vase . this is not my day !
it sure would . did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? she had horrible posture !
it looks like you are about to get dressed . did you forget we are in a car on the road ?
i will call the bus charter later . and have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
you know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ?
oh , yes . i remember tom . his family comes from maine , right ?
what did you see ?
i am reading a book about money management .

i will just try him again .
then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ?
are you going to have a birthday party ?
well i guess you have fewer characters but i think chinese grammar is easier .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
dear friends . here , i wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . actually i did not expect at all for this . i owe a lot to all of you here . it is been 5 days since i came to visit here . time really flies . i feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . i will miss you while i am leaving . let is keep in touch in any way . what is more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !
the taxi will be ready when you are , sir .
there is no food left from dinner .
ok , i suppose , but she is had a rough time in the last few years , she got divorced .
your offer is way off the mark . it set me back only sixty-five .
yes , i have got that here ...
i guess so , but i think it is going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes .
yes , i think you will be very satisfied with that one .
they would also like to have a meeting with our designers . and this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention .
all right . how much would you like to change ?
would you ask him to tell us more about the country ?
i wonder how the burglar did it .
the area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
okay , i will not forget .
me , too , haha .
mmmm . that sounds like something i had in mexico once .
yes . he is so energetic . we take him out to the park every morning and evening . i think he would be happy to stay there all day !
well , we have most of the furniture already . we mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that . and albert wants to set up a little off
i would like to speak to marked baker , please .
no . but now he will be in bigger trouble ! what is a boyfriend for ? forget about valentine is day ?
oh , you have already grown up , son .
here you are .
silk . you have a good taste . it is excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty .
here is $ 50 . keep the change , please .
do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ?
that would ruin things , i want to go so badly .
with snow in kunming ? that is crazy !
that is probably anne wallis .
but she cannot be home now . she might have gone to the library .
ok ... now how can i help , hon ?
we need to set the table for four .
thank you . how much is the fare ?
look at the ticket booth in the center . there seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be .
hey , young man ! i am your sis . do not talk to me like that .
so you must like nba game .
so who has to stay behind ?
no , really , it feels great .
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
that is very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing !
yes , but this will be my first time voting .
it starts at 7: 00 and lasts 3 hours .
thanks . but i am not so sure . interviews stress me out .
i do not like the play with complicated plot . what is on today ?
thanks a lot .
one love drives out another . you should not be afraid to start a new relationship .
great . that is just the sort of thing i am looking for . thanks .
yes , of course . i will call my home office tonight and let them know about it . when do we meet again ?
why do not we go to the 7: 30 show ? it is convenient to us , i think .

did you join the communist party of china cpc ?
it is just we have been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee
you are right , that is great .
besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an e-mail or a call .
why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? i am sure they would look fabulous on you .
what is that ?
they are quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . we need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . we also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they are not worn down . it is important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . there is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . if it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too .
oh , yes . money comes faster in that way than otherwise .
so how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?
wait for a minute , mr . brown , a single room with bath from today to the fifteenth .
sorry , madam . we do not have vacancies at the moment .
in that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better .
i am looking for a sweater .
if you have any problems , just call us .
no , thanks mom . i would like some toast and chicken wings .
no , honey , it is easy if you know the way .
sure . you just walk down this hallway . the copy room is the second room on the right .

i would like a banker is draft please . it is not really urgent .
actually , more and more people have realized that violence on tv may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers .
ok , anyway , let me have it .
how lovely it is !
what , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ?
oh , what is up ?
yes , certainly . what is that ?
a gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave this place the soonest .
he had a mask over his face .
what do you think might be the source of its popularity ?
probably , iris . that must be the job of nutritionists .

i would be glad to . he is really cute .

the thing that i find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .
you mean fat boy ?
we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
mr . chang , i just want to tell you that we are leaving london for beijing by flight cp 645 on saturday morning . could you meet us at the airport , please ?
yes , twice now . i think it is too high-tech , and so it is the first part that breaks .
cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
sorry , i am using it myself . but you can use it this afternoon .
well , corporate agreement savings will be based on the agreement deposit contract signed by the customer and the bank together . so , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . so , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of current deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal .
really ? why ?
take my word for it .

that is my cousin hubert . he likes smiling .
i am not sure , but i will arrange for you and inform you as well .

all right . wait a minute .
i will take this one .
yes , i like the color . can i try it on ?
and , who is sponsoring your trip ?
i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i did not pay much attention in art class at school .

really ? it is unbelievable .
exactly . instead , we should have some drinks tonight .
why do not you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?

have you had it a long time ?
can you afford that much ?
yes , this is jin lili . what can i do for you
firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . and secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . the last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
he did not say it was bad , but he said that it was not as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it .
it will be a long story . we have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . that is the sort of thing i can not bear .
my plans are not until later , so i will clean it before i go .
how about tomorrow morning at 9 ?
how long will the trip take from here to new york ?
thanks , pam . you are my lifesaver .
what did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
i think i know that .
it is about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . they reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . to our astonishment , about 20 of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . we cannot accept them in this state . they are unfit for human consumption . and the medical officer of health has issued a stop notice on them .
usually for lunch , we do not have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . but to be on the safe side , i will order a table for half-past twelve . will that suit your schedule ?
it is for a book .
of course , this is my first time here . my mom has a membership here . here is the card .
not at the moment maybe later , though .
i found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments .
no , sir .
well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans are not dressy enough . and i do not feel comfortable with that . what do you think , vicky ? you have been very quiet up to now .
what of it ?
maybe . how much is a room ?
sorry , i have no idea .
i can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles .
do not you spend a lot of money then ?
surely , of course .
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
i am not a very good singer , but i am a really great dancer ! i love hip hop dancing .
all right . just five minutes . be sure not to touch anything .
it is a blackout . now i cannot see seinfeld .
right . trains no . 13 and no . 14 are the best trains on the line between beijing and shanghai . which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ?
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
no problem . see you this afternoon .
what seems to be the problem ?
i will . many thanks , mr . black .
let me run through a couple of other options with you . that way , you can make a more informed decision .
ok , i will come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list .
ok . have you ever been on a double decker bus ?
i certainly am . i would have been very disappointed if i had not got them .
it is nice to meet you ! guess we will be working together .
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what i mean .
what is the problem ?
it is going to be $ 300 .
i appreciate your kindness .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
i am sorry to say no .
oh , jack ! that is wonderful !
i think so , hopefully we will have a long and a happy life together .
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood .

it is not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . i think we would better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have . we have reached the awareness level , but we have not established customer loyalty . people know who we are , but they still do not trust in our brand .
it is almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict , kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient , they might go wild .

and i can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .

you are welcome . thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me .
i am sorry . she is in a meeting right now .
oh , here it is . patulin . oh , no !
yes . speaking . is there anything i can do for you ?
i was a naughty boy and i played hooky . so the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week .
it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . do you feel thirsty most of the day ?
that is true . the bus is even worse . just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! hey , how do you get to work every day ?
you bet , as long as i can collect enough money .
that sounds great . i will boring a bottle of wine .
does that include breakfast ? can i make calls on outside line ?
mr . green ?
oh , really ? i go to the gym every day .
hurry up , little boy .
i hope that the owners are not insulted by that offer .
yeah , are you surprised ?
let me play it for you .
when do you plan on studying for those exams ?
no , what is it ?
you can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . otherwise , i will find another renter .
did you ever talk to him about it ?
you are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 rib , with a repayment period of up to 1 year .
sorry , sally , it is not your fault .
what do you mean ? you think i do not write enough .
is that all ?
here it is .
she sounds like a good teacher . do you think you will pass her class ?
we will give you our decision in a few days . how can we get in touch with you ?
your arms need to be raised to shoulder height .
but spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! you have got to have patience with him and teach him . it is not easy , i know . it is hard .
one moment , please . ah yes , mr . hilton , you booked a single room for three nights . is that correct ?
here it is . have you got the advice slip with you ? you have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead .

i hope that i get what i asked for .
yes , i can be there at 6 .
sure . we have one on the second floor .
no , that is the number l that goes down park avenue . this is the number 2 .
oh , yeah , it is terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it is when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
you cannot go down on the price ?
are you kidding ? i am terrible ! but i love to watch sports . i go to football or baseball games a lot . and i read sports magazines every week .
believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that is my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
it was held in 776 b . c . at olympia . it also has a long history of more than 2700 years .
lucky for you , this month we are not charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we will throw in this pen drive !

that is a lot of cooking . you must save a lot of money by eating at home so much .
he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ?

it is the holidays ! everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !
yes . i have been a data entry operator for three years .
sure . if you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . it is a very simple exercise , but very effective .
it is a scam 7 that is based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . the person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .
what kind of snack are you going to make ?
thanks for the offer . i will keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we will talk more after class .
i am sorry , miss . we cannot do it . we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out .

i was there between 88 and 90 .
i think you will lay it to rest with the time flying .
no , sir . the tax is included .
great ! i would love to get a little better discount than 6 , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ...
ok . do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english ?

yes , a red wine and a cup of coffee .
yes , here you go .
we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .
for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
we have squirrel shaped mandarin fish , seeds prawn , etc .
that is true . the weather is constantly changing .
you have taken words out of my mouth . he is a tough customer .

i can try , but knowing margaret she will see through that immediately .
thank you . the payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier is check .
that would work , but do not let it happen again .
go ahead , have a try and be a joke .
congratulations ! it is good to follow your heart . but i just did not expect to be so fast .
i cannot possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours !

it includes water , but not gas and electricity .
look ! you can see the village way down in the valley .

i am sure the security is very tight . probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport .

could you drop it off on sunday night ?
well-endowed ? do not worry . i have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back .
do not tell me you have a record player !

i am also wondering about the pay .

jones . according to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast .

i just want to talk to you about the tests that i want to run .
hi , this is susan smith . i am calling about my appointment with doctor brown today at 3
about 300 dozens .
m , a , double r , i , o , double t .

well then , i will see you on saturday . thanks for asking me to go with you .
sure , honey . i will read you a bed time story , too .
do not worry about it . but how was it ?
that is true . i can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered .
no problem , but what were you calling about ?
what happens if i cannot leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?

i park days and evenings .
oh ... that is too bad .
i think we should go out more frequently . the natural scenery can do us good .
now we have to walk .
no , there is a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they are the financial control system . then there is the ceo the chief executive officer . he is the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it is too dangerous . that is the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
you are back already . that sure was quick .
what is the price of this house in the flyer ?
check out your mom is closet . i will bet she still has something .

yeah , i know . shop till you drop .

it is my pleasure .
wait a moment . here you are .
remember , no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
hi , jim .
what color do you want ?
i did not see anything out of the ordinary , but i want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details .
we submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . they chose this one .
slide your card into the machine .
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 .
good . where shall we meet ?
yes , of course . well as you can see from the resume i am 27 and grew up in brooklyn , new york , although our family moved to london when i was quite young , at around sixteen .
thanks , dan .
have you got any plans ?
no , there is no double six at the of the number . it is just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight .
i am tired . i need a rest .
i am an engineer , i work for boeing . say , would you like a drink ?

star hotel . ok .
would it be convenient to see the room ?
yeah , yeah , i know what i selected . just give me my money !

i have no idea . oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning .
very well sir . would you like to have some shirts made also ?
her marriage was a hole and corner affair .
i may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction .
yeah , it sounds easy . how long does it take ?
here is a guiding plan .
say , how about a walk along the river ?
you are right , we do need leadership . but what we do not need is too many people to lead us . you know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough indians ...
certainly . please sign your name here .
you should not have stayed up so late watching tv . i told you we had to get an early start .
madam , patience is a virtue .
yes , here you are .
how about making a teriyaki bowl ?
i think the key point is to be considerate of your co-workers ' feelings and needs and make a good working environment .
thank you for your advice ! i will try it .
yeah . i have got much pressure in the company . i have tobe wrapped upon my work .
i have got it under control .
maybe . but i d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds .
that will be fine for now , thank you .
why are they stricter with chinese people than with other nationalities ?
yes , plenty of them . do not eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
i had an interview with your company two weeks ago . i am calling to ask about the interview result . i hope you can give me a positive reply .
well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial o .
that was quick ! i was not expecting it until later this week .
i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach .
yeah , especially since it is ninety degrees outside .
i think he is got too much on his plate .
yes , take the greyhound bus . it will lead you directly there .
definitely . it not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul .
good morning . i have a reservation for a single room with a bath here .
let is go in to wait for them .
sorry , we have not made the decision at all .
sure , that sounds good .
not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop .
i am so sorry ! ok , so you just want a simple message on it .
perfect . i wanted to have a casual evening tonight .
i am going to give you a ticket .
it is much too hard for his age .
i know , our schedules are so weird . sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that is open when we get home .
would you please have a look at my report ? i hope the project meets your demand .
by the way , how much does it cost to send a package to taiwan ?
when you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ?
make it after the present fashion , please . what if it does not fit ?
i am never coming back .
all right . i only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way .
thanks for coming , it was a real blessed .
in my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports .
what kinds of currency do you change ?
you already finished off everything , sir ?
i heard through the grapevine that your getting married .
yeah . web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ericsson .
it is the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . these are really expensive !
it should have gone around to everybody . they also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . do not you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ?
i have booked you for one window seat on american airline flight no . 409 . have a good trip !
i can smoke outside of the office . but what else does it say ?
oh , hello , lucy . what is up ?
the flight number is 301 at gate two .

i know what you mean .
please ! you can do it . their clothes are all laid out on the bed .
thank you . good afternoon mrs . smith , miss duncan , miss lamb .
everything about them was different , even the theaters .
dad , come on ! just tell me .
i think it is great ! i really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . i have actually been eyeing that dress at maxine is for a while now , but i was not sure i could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
yes , it is . please put your luggage on the scale .
where shall we go now ? a chinese restaurant or a local one ?
i will ask mrs . thou when she is available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ?
wait ! look at that board , what is on it ?
it may not be the best choice for me , but i am considering it .
the price per night is $ 308 .
yes . we should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading .
what else would i prepare , sir ?
sometimes pink is not bad , too .
i think it is going to be the same as today . clear and sunny .
no way , kate . i mean it is just not my fault .
i can believe that .
sure he is . winter swimming does good to health , i hear .
that sounds good . at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that i think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person .
he is going to make the opening speech .
my mother-in - law . she retired last year .
thank you . how much is it ?
today is my first day at work !
i appreciate that .

how do you know that ?
you are always so careless .
we cannot reach a final decision until we have talked to all of the other five applicants . anyhow , we will contact you within this month . all right . nice meeting you . good-bye .
let is get it back .
no , but i would like to . do you have to pay to do instant messaging ?
is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?
wow , you are so lucky . i saw that one on tv . but it must be so different to be there in the concert hall .
yes . come with me to the vitamin section .
it will be fine .
so , you like red apples better ?
sure , when ?
is this the sign ? what does it say ?
hello . i am here today to pay in some foreign currency . is that possible at this counter ?
we are not interested in small orders . i suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen .
is this 777-9345 ?
did you receive your pin number yet , madam ? you see , unless you have your new pin number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . we usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
all right . thanks .
do you want to go out to eat ?
you know , i really must be going now or i will be very late . can you give me a call tomorrow an we will decide ?
yes , i agree . we will make sure that they get notified . can you find the meeting place ?
hmm . perhaps it should be the only important thing . but it is not . not in this company .
oh no ! i forgot about those too ! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily .
how were you sick ?
do you have any work experience in promotion ?
you have to be very careful with seafood . it tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . have you heard anything from tom ?
trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
yes , you are seeing him on thursday . you are inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening .
i do not think you will need to wear it for a while . it is been really hot lately .
never mind . i will do it .
yes , speaking . can i help you ?
peter kaufman , p-e-t-e-r peter , k-a-u-f-m-a-n kaufman .
well , i understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . but first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it is still in there . if she finds it , we will all be happy . if she does not , we will turn the whole matter to the police . but i must say that the hotel cannot be held responsible for your loss . you should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel is safety box . if you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .
why did you transfer ?
about 7 of the clock .
thanks . have you got any light bulbs ?
really ? what about your opinion , daniel ?
is this all right .
thank you very much .
well , fish it will be then .
see all these black areas ? that is tar built up in your lungs .
i hope so .
can you tell me my choices ?
you do not need to bend your elbows that much . bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . the most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .
i do not know . where did you leave it ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
yeah ... i know . but i am sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
we are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th street .
you paid the last time , because i did not have any money , remember ?
let is get a shopping cart .
i do not know because i have not received my test results yet .
why not ? it is the very reason why i have applied for this job . it is really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment .
i did not know that before .
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people do not seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
hi , good morning , you are so early today .
chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . they are very good in colour , flavour , and taste .
i am still not sure about these ' visible ' certificates . what is the real difference , except the amounts available ?
david hall , 83 , bridge street .
they might be too hot for me .

i would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
i am not .
the movie company has to pay them ?
are you a doctor ?
it feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . it seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .
how long does it take to get to the hotel ?
i have cigarettes for my own use .
can you show me the way , please ?
do not worry about your flu . you will be ok soon .
i will remember that for next time . you will get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ?

as many as you like , sir . they are beautiful , are not they ?
my birthday present ? i cannot help telling you that i am a happy woman , darling . i will come back soon . go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to steven .

oh , you look stunning . your dress really goes well with your shoes .
i know he really deserves this .
that is kind of you to say . but ... the stuff we do here has not really challenged me very much at all .
fine . we provide a company car for our consultants .

it is no big deal .
sorry , sir , just visa or mastercard .
i am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund .

i joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . with a combination of eating better and exercising , i managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .
how can i find out if i can collect ?
china provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . we import more than 40 different items from china . most of the imports that come out of china are low-grade plastics or toys . japan produces many electronic exports , germany produces excellent mechanical exports .
is doctor hawkins here ? she is our doctor . we called her from the car .

just a moment , please . i am sorry , sir . there is no ticket available on that day . but we have flights for guangzhou the next day .
tomorrow is friday . it is going to be the weekend .
when you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .

sure , no problem . do you want me to edit it for you ?
so do i . i do not like cats .
let is leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway .
i am not sure if that would be wise .
we will have our own secure internet banking service . what it is , is a sort of online financial service for enterprises and individuals , so you could get it . it is for doing all types of e-business .

how could he make such a silly mistake ?
in a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all .
i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others .

what dates are you planning on taking off ? i will need at least two months notice , so that i can plan for your absence .
how about rumba ?
welcome . one of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
oh , sorry ! i forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . i will be right there .

the seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they are already occupied by somebody else .
i bet . why not go over and talk to her ? she is really nice .
he is a postman .
of course you should . you would not want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
you guessed it . she says we have to get married on january 2nd , or we will have bad luck .
oh , really ? do you know why ?
that is very sensible of you . we have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments .

thirty bucks a record . or five for one hundred and twenty bucks .
i really hate receiving spam . i also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway .
medicine . in my country , that certainly has great prestige .
this tv is $ 2500 .
sure . may i see your receipt ?
just a moment , please , while i check . that is correct . you have a double room on the fifth floor .
yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . hey ! how about that one over there ?
yes , maybe it does . but if you are going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
i am very sorry i cannot .
what time did he come in last night ?
certainly . four more stops after this . i will call out the stops .
here it is . four pounds and fifty pence in all .
i am living at room 222 , building 18 , n . p . u .

not everything , just this film . even the title is ridiculous , and it is so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that i am thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? if everyone is discontent with their work , of course they will not stick arround .
our products are of good quality . since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we have had to increase them on some items by about ten percent . if you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent
where will we sleep , then ?
then when did you go to sleep ?
oh , no . most of the time i do these things . she is a writer .

oh , jane . what on earth have you been ? i have called you a thousand times .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?

oh , dear !
oh , yes , i would !

the swim stations are available to all guests for no charge .
i do not have my resume with me , but i will send you a copy immediately . can i fill out the application form right now ?
yes . how much do you want ?
that is true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .
yes , they are right . in fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade .
the bank will give you a pin , and you can withdraw money from any atm .
at the supermarket down the street . help yourself .
oh , it is really nice , but to tell the truth , that is far too expensive .
i did not realize it was so difficult though i know i am always too nervous in such competition .
really ? what can i do now ? i cannot miss the important meeting .

yes . and he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university .
you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time ?
that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it is exactly what you are looking for .
well , it is just that i think if you do not enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
look , the reason i came into your store is because i was spending the day with annabell and matt . and i was buying them presents . i am the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . and there is only one place to find a children is book in the neighborhood . that will not always be the case . and it was yours . and it is a charming little bookstore . you probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year .

so , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
the old page was okay , alright , but there was not a big influence in our sales volume , because the site was not developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . now it is different . we got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ...

yes , at first i felt very awkward . after bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! i mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . and then i was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ...
i have heard about it , but never had one .
you should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ?

oh , yes please ! i would love a gin and tonic .
then there is the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine . most southerners like them .
the stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and i do not see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .
after you have chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? just use a very small amount of oil . fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .

i am seeing that you are doing ok in some areas , but not so well in others .
i am doing great ! thank you for asking , joe .
oh , my . what did you do ?
i do not like ads , either . but ads could bring big profits to the tv station .
and why are you returning them ?
wow , your apartment is a mess .
well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything .
ok , i will see you then .
it is a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
later here is your card , sir . you are all checked in . let me just tell you about a few of our services . we have free breakfast in the lounge from 7: 00- 9: 00 . you call the receptionist to arrange

such concern for the company , craig ! i am impressed .
what is that ?
i really would rather just listen . is not there anyone else who wants to sing ?

exactly . you know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . you remember ? the island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
well , cannot you make it for two only ?
oh hi jim . no i just got back . i thought you were on vacation now .
yes . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . there is a lot of competition between banks nowadays . each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .
no , it is the japanese team .
yes , there is one just on the other side of this building . do you have any small change ?
yes , i learned how to speak it when i was little .

and he looks like a typical jog .
nice to see you again .
i have learned many courses , such as civil law , economic law , commercial law and administration law .
good . he is a man of high standing . i think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . but i suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
you are absolutely right . the acting could be better .
no , nothing special . oh , yes , you know bill , the guy with the moustache . his wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , he said his wife and daughter are doing fine . the baby is their first child .
oh ? what is wrong with his girlfriend ?
this is mary speaking . who is that ?
well , that is for all . excellent !
we have a dinner reservation for four at 7: 00 under the name of foster .

can you take a little advice from a friend ?
but he has the sex scandal .
bad timing . i want to see them so much . how are they ?

oh ! what a beautiful dress ! it fits you so well . you look so charming in the dress .
how time flies . but hey , how are things going with you ?
i am well . and you ?
i had mine when i was 24 . that is a little young . i would suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
it is possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
sure . go back and take the third turning on the left .
instead , i sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
only 1 hour .
yeah , it is very funny . have you ever watched it before ?
last year he helped me out of trouble , too .
are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ?
oh , i bet it is really quiet . but is there much to do there ?
the color i use now is natural beige . how much do you sell it for ?
likewise . bye !
yes , we will not travel again until october .
that was quick .
that is a lot of money .
we are glad to hear that . what items are you particularly interested in ?
i told her that i am an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally .
ok . thanks for that information .
yes . do you want to go with me ?
there are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels i can recommend .
yes , i wrote a thesis entitled english education in high school and it was published in the education magazine .
is that right ? wonderful , wonderful . i have been in king dao for two years now . a great place . nice people and great beer ! well , i guess we would better get started .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
if sounds so tempting . why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? they charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years .
that is a good idea . do you know anyone who has done that before ?
studying english would not give me any satisfaction . it is hard work .
her room is very neat and clean .
okay . our rental agent will be with you in a moment .
last time i lent you money , you never paid me back .
if you are so hungry , why do not you ask someone else for money ?
what ? where does that five come from ?
i need to see if we can get together today .
great ! how will we be getting there ?
no problem at all .
you are welcome .
thank you for your encouragement .
i can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . i can see cars driving on the streets . i can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . i can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air .
you will get that information in court .
all right , mr . jones . do you think we will need anything else ?
is this your first semester ?
what does it say ?
do you like western music ?
we are happy together now . we both think that we are a well-matched couple .
let me check the stock . how about this one ?
it is fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
let is try it !
see you later .
cheers ! and we are honored to have such an honored guest today . mr . james , i hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
have you been to california before ?
i think it is going very well , actually . we had a long meeting with them . after several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer .
my father wants me to work as a trainee in his company .
when did you begin to smoke ?
yes , of course . the balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner is equity .

right . we will ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by houston commodities inspection bureau , which is final and binding on both parties .
here you go then . have a great school year !
my car has broken down .
i am sure it will . it will be of great help in carrying on the work i have done so far .
yeah . i hate spending all day in there , too .
i am starting loving this bakery now .
here you are .
did they say for how long ?
it is harmful . not only for yourself but for others .

that is very inconvenient for you then . you will probably have a cast on your left arm .
my wife and me . the two of us .
i just cannot help it . oh , look at clive , he is really a big hit . they are definitely gonna win .
what do you mean ?
you are welcome .
homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each .
thanks again . i will start on next monday . i am sure i will have good performance .
yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
ok , let is go then !
i think you are right , but it does seem that there are always a few coworkers that are harder to work with than others .
well , of course , the choice is up to you . good luck !
no , can i trouble you to lend me a hand ?
ours are of really good quality .
all this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues .
my father and sister are out to photographing . what about you ?
can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ?
she is your sister . what she asked was only duck soup for you . why cannot you be good to her ?
as you know , china has a single-child policy . therefore , there is just my husband , my daughter and i . what about in your family ?
no , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . they just did not have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . the writing was also a little weak .
of course we do ! my father is parents , mum , dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me .
peter madsen . a great a if i do say so myself .
about half an hour ago i fell on the ground and hurt my leg . it bled a lot .
and how long do i have to stay in berlin for the connecting flight ?
not a bad idea .
you can exchange this dress with anything of the same value .
thank you . here you go .
two people chat on the net and step by step fall into love ! it is net love .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
what qualities do you think are important to this position ?
well , sounds promising . but i think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . we need not bother signing for the language by ourselves .
thank you , doctor .
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors .
i am glad to hear that .
oh yes , i have heard of that one . everyone i have spoken with says that it is great !
yes . we enjoyed ourselves very much . have you traveled much , luke ?
well , that is life .
yes , it sure is . i had to run here from work ! i need to rush as i am on my lunch break .
first , change your shoes to slippers . then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower .
the problem is you are too nervous . you want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . and when it comes to the i second roll , there is no pressure . that is why you could bowl all those spares .
fine , honey . rome could not be built with in one day .
yes , he married my sister ten years ago .
this is li with silk company . we met last sunday during the exhibition .
i only typed several copies of my resume .
i am afraid ... be can returned by eleven of the clock .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
yes , i recalled you charging that before . and i thought it was extortionate ! haha !
no wonder you are named shopaholic .
no . it is mike is sporting goods .
which seafood do you prefer ?
oh , it seems there is nothing that evening .
i need two wake-up calls , if you do not mind , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen .
yes , it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
well , basically it is similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . you should try it at least once .
okay . i think i will be awake by then .
how many employees are there in total in the company ?
the picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . i think that we should go look at it since we are here .
and for your entree ?
are you really ?
our first choice would be 7
shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments .
what have you got ?
well , you do not seem to be interested in getting a real job , either .
is friday good ?
no , this will help answer your question . in american society boys and girls are raised together . they are not segregated in their activities ! boys and girls go out together from an early age .
no . what did it say ?
i know ! it is an amazing growth opportunity ! they are true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development .
look into the mirror and see if it will do .
really ? you did not find a wallet ?
it is 90 dollars in all .
wow . too bad i do not have a clue about housework .
at nine thirty-six . and the nine eighteen gets to london at nine fifty-five , the ten thirty-two at eleven nine .
i have not thought about it yet .
and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . there is one final reason why so many people are fat .
sure . what would you want to have today , chinese food or western food ?
yes , it is essential .
who is playing ?
much better . my heart sank when mary told me that she wanted to leave me .
i will think about it .
then you can try some local products . they are also of good quality .

i am not sure when it started . but i know it is older than me . as a young boy , i used to eat here a lot .
i have never gone to camp . what do you do there ?
the disease fails to respond to drugs .
rubin ! karen and mike have spoken about you so often that i feel like i have met you before .
i am sorry , but everything is taken .
so what is the problem ?
i did not think of it . thank you . and i do apologize for being late .

ok . by the way , please get them pressed .
i am sorry - it is my fault . i was filling the bathtub and i left the water running too long , so it overflowed .
really , mmmm . arm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ?
we have only one mid-size car left .
is that hello kitty ?
yes , sir .
better not forget that , so kill you if you do not get her something .
glad to meet you , mr . white .
he is very nice , actually , but rather eccentric .
of course i forgive you . what are friends for ? now , what am i going to do for that other guy ?
yes , i am serious this time .
thanks . actually , i was really surprised . i mean there were a lot of qualified people out there .
shall i come in and collect it ?
your price is rather high . we cannot accept it . can you bring the price down a little ?
great . i will bring the food .
what is the problem ?
we will be in touch with you by telephone or by mail within a week . well . goodbye .
i would rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
yes , sir . what can i do for you ?
oh , it is really beautiful . but i just cannot dance it well .
a garage sale ... that is where people check out cars , right ?
well , there is nothing we cannot handle . i will spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and fu
the help is mutual . i must thank you to see me off . my wife and i will be looking forward to seeing you . you will come to see us , will not you ?
i have a leaky pipe .
oh good , come in , please .
yeah , but it is not more expensive than international calls .
i am sorry , sir .
what is the date today ?
you are welcome .
i think it is wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .

okay , i will let you sleep for a little while longer .
when are you getting married ?
you are right . thank you for your cooperation .
fine . i will just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .
this is a very nice place . how long have you been living here now ?
sure , it is easy . first of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . people are listening and they usually do not have a long attention spans . stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . be straightforward and organized and you are sure to be remembered .
i thought you knew .
mormons believe that , after the death of christ and the death of the apostles 10 , their church christ founded became corrupt and the authority of christ on earth was lost to men . in 1830 , a prophet named joseph smith was brought up by god to restore the church .
i do not buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
oh , you have already grown up , son .
not bad , thanks .

listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
when you miss a day of school , i will be happy to give you the english assignments .
i remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who do not want to forget .
just relax . we will talk about it this afternoon .
i haver run out of gas .
you can ask questions about the position you are applying for .
hmm , that is good . can you use cedar or redwood to build it ?
let me guess . you want to watch the history channel again !
no , not yet . but susan says they would like to get married in november or december . then they will go to hawaii for their honeymoon .
in mathematics i got a 98 .
happy mother is day to you , mum !
you get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable .
okay , tom .
how about its quality ?
yes , i have prepared . i have also prepared a meeting memo .
yes , it did . it went off thirty minutes ago . you slept right through it . you are like a dead person while you sleep .
i would like the beef .
oh , i see . i also heard today is the last day for the street fair . cannot wait to sample all the snacks .
right , we have located a business partner in seoul . the first contact proves to be successful . the general manager of south korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . i think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon .
my wife will be going back to work soon .
i think i can manage that . let is see ... yes , here we are .
yeah , it is , a little bit . i joined the great outdoors club , though , which has been a lot of fun . we have gone on two camping trips already , and i have made some good friends .
i wish it did not have cruise control . my wife does not like it either .
well , she is quite short .
yes , i agree with you on the point but could not the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?
this is our rock-bottom price and we cannot make any further reduction .
about one day . it arrives in dalian at 10: 00 a.m . tomorrow .
how much would you like to deposit ?
do not worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you do not have to pay the whole amount of money at once .
yes , tomorrow is my friend is birthday . could i arrange a birthday party for him through you ?
does this mean that if i might want those new european bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ?
where are we ?
i see . i had no idea our advertising was so misleading . it is here , but it is in the fine print on the last page .
i do not like going to the theatre .
yes . just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - -
yeah , i just cannot find it anywhere .
is it good ?
do you think the taxi driver will understand you ?
for the construction site manager ?
i am going to give you some advice , jone . if this happens again , you should call the police immediately . you should try to remember everything . you should explain everything to the police .
well , i guess it might take some time to get used to .
where are you from , ms . baker ?
yes , i adore simple fashions . how does it look on me ?
here is the bath .
thanks a lot . my wife and i will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit .
i went to tamshui . you ?
then what price would be fair to you ?
right . let me see . you go straight down here and turn right .
oh , i agree . we both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress .
what about the features in the room ?
it only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright .
1: 30 p.m . but i have got to check in at 12: 30 p.m .
really ? this is a nice office , but it is quite small .
yes , maybe i should .
it is quite a delicate piece of equipment , so i hope it was well-packed . it is oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . it is made of metal .
hi . last month , our company , turner interiors of beijing , ordered some documents under our new l c . what i want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet .
please . and in the mean time , can i look at apartments available in the area from this office ?
they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .
please feel assured that we will abide by our promise . and we will do everything we can to ensure delivery .
yeah , me too . did you hear about ted ?
you would better take some medicine and have a good rest . i hope you will be yourself pretty soon .
nope , actually i was waiting for you . i have something big to tell you .
i am afraid not . i have not worked in an american company so far .
let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by june 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by august 15 . right ?
of course . it is be against the law if we did not .
oh , thanks . please tell him to call my cell-phone number .
i think i can accept that .
yes . i could use a cup of coffee .
same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
why do not you ask your husband to help you with it ?
no . i recorded these from your cds .
they do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it is not much of an incentive . they give us a bonus of ten dollars .
you just ate .
not only that , but i am going to buy you that video game after all !
i would love to , but you know i have got another appointment . i am really sorry .
well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it was not actually that expensive .
well , i like to play the piano .
how about this ... we can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and i will order some chinese food for delivery . it will be my treat .
you like my living room set , do not you ?
i think you are right . climate change naturally over time , but i think that human activities are speeding up the change . i wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem .
the price per copy is ten cents .
yes , but whom to ?
are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ?
it is very hot , the temperature is often over 40 c .
i see . but why do not you continue to work as a teacher ?
do not be so happy , it is just one of my tests !
yes . look , it is on my desk .
i am looking for the cameras .
i have a question .
of course , otherwise you will just have to wait for hours .
i would like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . could you make a recommendation for me ?
shame on you . i was saving them for your brother .
the chicken is also nice .
yes , that is all right . thank you very much .
it is very hard , you know .
what is tiananmen famous for ?
i thought you wanted to know more about her .
1 ? that is too low a rate . could you see your way to increase it to 2 ? .
please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
there are 15 people in my family .
well , i am glad to hear it . have a cup of coffee !
so it seems . and what are you going to do about that ?
that is right .
of course . i will .
yeah , but i get that sometimes . it does not matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we will always be foreigners in their eyes .
here you are .
you are such a dreamer ! you think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ?
how long have your headaches been going on ?
yes . but not including the utilities .
good . now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging .
but i cannot resist a good dinner .
well ... er ... it is just ... just that i ...
do not worry about it . all in all , you have done very well in school .
gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome .
well , it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
there is some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . i do not think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . what we need is a tourniquet .
do you have a warranty on it ?
hold on , with that wind , you are going to catch a cold . wear this scarf .
you were dull at that time .
no . but i am working on it .
that is too bad . we could really use someone who is bilingual .
it is traveller is cheques , is that possible ?
would you like your hair washed as well ?
can you go ?
nope . our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . we do not think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making .
i will till the soil and then sow the seeds . i will then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
it is about an invoice which is wrong .
i see . well , thank you very much for helping me . you have been very helpful .

it is a serious problem . i make expecting an important call . the theater is guilty . it supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . what were happened if they cannot reach me ?
this apartment looks nice .
what ? ! is not there a law against that , i think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . you should know your rights ! if you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .
at nine sharp .
how many days will you be out of school ?
really ? what did you think ?
look , there is a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing .
no , i have only got one . ok , thank you all the same .
you are still wet behind the ears . you should have seen through her .

fine , thanks . how is your boy , jack ?
but that still sounds expensive .
do you have some new perfume ?
i am not sure how .
this is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . we know everyone who lives around here .
it is too expensive to get it fixed .
i will explain the problem briefly . we found in the examination that 35 of the goods have damaged .
do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ?
well , his son had an accident and bill does not have health insurance . this really got me thinking , and i wondered if we should not look into a couple of different hmo is .

i am a little short . i do not have enough for you .
er , may i know how much i will be paid monthly ?
yes , that is just one of the services we offer in our personal financing program .
sure , great effect . my weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 .

your table is ready , sir ? please step this way .
really ? how to do that ?
yes , of course . will you come with the receipt ?
what did happen ?
i can think of two things made of paper stationery and money .
never mind . after all he is not so attractive as yao ming , right ?
what do you mean ?
yeah , yeah , i know , it is totally cliche , but really , i think it is been a good decision . i have got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . what about you ? what have you been up to ?
thanks for noticing .
is there any thing else , sir ?
we do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . we are a good , small company , that is why you are interested .
round-trip or one-way ?
and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto , right ?
i see . that is ok . i will pay .
you would better get up or you will be late .
i like miniskirt .
unfortunately , an atm is being refilled because it ran out of money . that is what is causing the hold up .
sure , anything you say .

my domicile is beijing .
i will accompany my wife to the hospital .
sure . you look like you are all black and blue .
not yet . but i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
ok , let me hear it . i would be glad to help if i can .
i am not sure .
working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . what else do you have ?
well , if that is the case , i do not mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . i can only do what i know , and live how i have lived all my life , because i am a fairly stubborn person .
well , i lost my grandpa when i was only ten . i often recall the period when he fed me .
nice to see you , mrs . smith .
ok , so now we need a baking pan right ?
better take the subway . it is far quicker and more convenient .
what are you reading ?
that is true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
of course . it is on memorial avenue .
i am going out in about half an hour .
dad , i have to do my homework .
it depends if you are interested in the city . you might like to tour it by car i can be your guide , we will leave the afternoon free . you can do some shopping in the mall if you like .
sorry . was i disturbing you ?
yes , if any one is available . but not over the wing .
okay , i will take one .
okay , sir , here you are . thank you very much .
well , i do not like it , but i guess i do not have any choice .
what kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ?
that is right , because he is got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . in all , the trip is got to take more than 2 hours .
good heavens . why did you take so many ?
i am not sure . perhaps you could do the shopping .
hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
everything is great . and you ?
after the new year .
but the parking might be .
you are kidding .
all right , maria . i will give you until tomorrow at 4: 00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you will have to re-do it .
you are not lying , i found that movie absolutely hilarious .
sounds great ! can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? i will get some souvenirs for my friends .
i see . how much do i need to pay in total for this package ?
indeed . i love the smell of the grass and trees . they certainly refresh my mind .
may i know your name , please ?
i have got all the presents i need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . that is easy , but i have another problem to deal with .
i go to movies i go to lectures i listen to the radio i do lots of things . most importantly , i practice every chance i get .
that will be a tough match , right ?
what made you decide to join our company ?
really ? i hope to meet him soon .
it is so unreliable . i have been late for my meetings all this week .
if it were up to stanley , we would have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
ok . but i hope it will not take too long .
he must have been in bad company , or he would not be off the beans .
i never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm .
we need a lot of things this week . i must go to the grocer is . we have not got much tea or coffee , and we have not got any sugar or jam .
good . i will give you a call tonight .
that is why i can profit from it !
it is because of my son . dick keeps getting on my nerves
i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
with this ring i thee wed . wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment .
of course , i would like to .
happy anniversary ! sorry you will not be there . maybe some other time ?
which tests do you mean ?
it is for the drinks .
of course , here you are .
oh , forget it then . hey , i told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk .
i did not even think about that .
this way please . we offer multiple manicure services here . do you want a full service ?
do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you are shopping ?
well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive .

yes , of course .
i hope to make 4,000 yuan a month for supporting my family .
yes , all the cabins are fit for two .
come on , let is try it .
you mean the room 1818 ?
sorry , i cannot .
listen , i really do not know why you are making this into such a big issue . it is only a small piece of garbage in a large space . it is not like there is garbage everywhere . besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another .
my rear bumper is messed up .
now you know .
of course not . you are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you do not disturb the class . in universities , you study in a free and creative environment .
yes , yes , he is right here by me .
i can make it for you if you like .
oh , i am sorry . let me go back to the cashier is to have it changed . a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill .

not at all . i see you and your family twice a week , and i enjoy seeing my own friends . i am too busy to feel lonely !
i think it suits you well .

can i keep the apartment if i pay my rent in full ?
well , it has to be cheap . i do not want a really expensive apartment .
no , i am not .
sure . oh , that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
sir , i am michelle , and i run the front desk . please tell me the days you will be here .
not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe .
we could take the subway , but we would have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
zina ? zina the snake ?
where exactly are you coming from ?
his life sucked . he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down .
yes , i did . but i was not qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in .
i believe so .

about seven thirty . by the way , could you also bring me tomorrow is papers ?
yeah , are you going to come ?
yes , it is important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . to make full use of the network settlement service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
yeah , you are right , but it is really interesting .
it is got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .

it is more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
what is your trial about ?
i tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . just kidding . oh , your cubicle is over the . and this way . those are all private offices--the managers ' offices .
yes . i have to call the property management .
yes , it is very great .
yes , all our rooms have complimentary wireless internet .
what does the notice say ?
let is give it a shot !
oh , how interesting . and what about larry and rocky ?
how amazing ! i have never seen it before . is it expensive ?
that is a lot of money ! what did you do ? break the piggy bank ?
come on , bruce . come on , bruce .
the housework is really a big problem for me . my husband is on a business trip to the u . s . now and i have to take care of everything myself .
you are welcome , jack . glad to be of help .
what is the secret then ?
we give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . surely requiring people to take them could not possibly help . it sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me .
i am not sure , what about you ?
i was sick .
you just missed one .
because they are direct communication with another person , and there is a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of english .
you must be kidding ! you cannot get that price anywhere .
that sounds good but i do not know what is on .
i am not . i get a stomachache just thinking about it .
hi , i am henry wilson from number 37 .
no problem . i will be in touch as soon as it comes in .
i want to work full-time .
is this going to cost me anything ?
that is trail mix !
i do not like green apples .
ok . i cannot wait to see it . let is go !
has anything else happened to you ?
we run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor .
dude , what are you talking about ? only girls do that .
is it really completely flat ?
it is so pleasant after the bad weather we have been having .
whatever you prefer .
of course he was called ' the father of the olympics ' .
not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that is one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month .
that is good . see you on friday .
i have got a sore throat and my chest hurts .
i think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh .
it appears these books are two weeks late .
steve , i was born ready ! i am going to blow you guys off the treadmill today .
i have got the details here . 10,000 rib sent by mr ck chen from guangzhou . could i see some id ? you passport , for example ?
ok . i have got a list of place that fit your requirements . let is just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it is on a noisy street and it is a little far from the university .
how do you feel about it ?
mccain is our new president .
all right . i know a great restaurant near here . but , it is a little expensive and i do not have much money with me .
what ? you mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? no , thank you ! next !
i want to keep both of them , if that is possible .
this is room 705 . the air conditioner in my room does not work .
nothing , son . i am already very happy .
no , seriously ... i really want this .
we have a variety of transportation services . would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ?
how did you do it ?
i always approach things very enthusiastically . when i begin something , i do not like to leave it half-done . i cannot concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
what time does it leave ?
little dude , your life is over !
good . i will take care of it .
hello . i have a reservation , under the name lee , leo lee .
sure . how do you want it ?
are you sure you want to go ?
i am sorry . that table has been booked .
well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that do not get lost in the cyberspace . you know internet will not do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . there are a lot of per
i think you deserved this .
yes , i finally have an inspiration .
yes , please have a seat , and we will discuss this right now .
splendid ! when is it gonna be finished ?
certainly , mr . baker .

perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house .
yes , come on , and we will have fun .
how did you figure out how to slove the rubik is cube ?
what are you talking about ?
not much i can do . it is always there . i sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that is only a temporary solution . the stress always returns in the morning .
ok . here goes .
really ? what could that be ?
that is nice . where is his villa ?
is not that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am .
right , then you would better send an e-mail to tell her .
congratulations , bob ! that is great news , what is her name ?
as i said , i am diligent and industrious . on the other hand , i am too hard-working and i put myself under much pressure to make things perfect .
i have no idea .
i want to go to shanghai , but i also want to visit hainan .
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult .
i do not have another one .

i know . i know . i am really sorry . i lost my bag .
i am going to do some jogging on the treadmill . then i think i will do some work with the dumbbless .
yes , i read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . i would like to go for the guarantee mode , please .
and what is your call regarding ?
yeah ? how is he doing ?

yeah . there is a lot we can do to help him through this transition .
oh , i guess i will let you through then .
i like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i would love to go with you .
then , walk two more blocks an you will see city hall on the left . have you got all that ?
i want the chocolate one . i want to have it the big waves .
i can read the subtitles . my set is a huge-screen one .
and could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
let is see ... wanted
oh ! i hate rainy days !
it is $ 160 .
ok , where can i find one ?
what starting salary would you expect here ?
perhaps you are right , , though . maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
yes . i am interested in applying for graduate school in america .
a bar of soap !
that purple one . i am sorry ... i have never bought jewellery for anyone and i am kind of nervous .
does it include the charge for drinks ?
oh , i see . how old is she ?
now what are you doing ?
linda , thank you for this wonderful christmas dinner . i really enjoyed it .
do not worry , marian , i have got you covered .
no , not at the moment .
i may just do that .
what are these trees opposite to the pine trees ?
do you have any dutiable items ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents .

yeah . it was so easy and super-fast , once i figured it out .
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they ' ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
there is some leftover pizza from last night .
all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up .
oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
yes , that is right .
as i said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
which direction do i want ?
then , what do you think i should do ?
i would like to do that right now , if i could .
i see . wait for a moment please . i am sorry , mrs . clinton , but the remittance does not appear to have arrived yet .
i am sorry we cannot now .
his mother , not me , should do this .
never mind , dear .
sorry , he is out .
do you know what camcorder options are available ?
i bet ac milan will lose .
you see , but i do business on a commission basis . a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . even two or three percent would help .
when was the last time you have track up ?
yes , i think you are right . i am thinking about having a child , but not just yet .
please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it is so cute and tame .
that is a great idea . i will try it on .
with that attitude , i do not really think we have much more to discuss here .
i am trying to learn new skills . it makes me more qualified for a good job .
that is pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate .
that is for sure . you are new , too , huh ?
you should get plenty of sleep .
i want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .
the fee is 25 cents every day .

well , trust me . the quality is fantastic .
yes , of course . here it is .
that is what i understand .
no , i have never heard of this song before . it is beautiful ! who sing it ?
he is in the third grade sam ! you see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . a one means his achievement or work is excellent . here in science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .
hopefully , i will get accepted to ucla .
i will be expecting you , then .
ok , thank you .
what did you do in the interview ?

yes , i have got all that here .
i know about this fact . american children are more independent . they do more for themselves . but i am from taiwan . in taiwan , children must study very hard . so the mother does everything for the kids . the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school . so i have never washed clothes before . you should not laugh at me for it .

but i need someone that i can count on for this job .
a laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you . do you understand ?
me too . did you play when you were a kid ?
a driver died instantly . the other one was badly hurt . a poor boy called peter was killed in the accident too .
it is easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .

but what ? you always act like this , when you face difficulties .
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
i never chatted online before . what is it like .
how much would you like to borrow ?

let me go and get that for you .
what are you going to do ?

i understand your position , and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
i was busy doing something . i apologize .
was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa .
my sister and i usually go to the laundromat down the street . why do not you go there ?
oh ! it is perfect . i think i will take it . would you wrap it , please ?
you want to buy one now ?

there is a leaking pipe in my wall .
no , i did not know i could do that .

you are welcome .
seven children ? that is a lot . why did your parents have so many ?

ok , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees fahrenheit .
well , obviously , what you are doing is not good enough !
you like horror movies ? i do not like them because they are too scary ! i like comedies because i love to laugh .

wow , it is quite far away from here . i am afraid you are gonna have to take bus no . 713 .
no , probably not . for the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours .

oh , thanks , professor donald . this is really very nice of you .
that is great . i thought you said you did not get the job .
no , i do not . but i do know where the shopping mall is .

as you know , before shipment , the commodity inspectionbureau inspected the goods in question . they concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export .
sorry , not before 10: 30 .
thousand island , please .
it is okay . i am still waiting to hear from ucla anyway .
i guess so . better to find out now than after you are married , when it is harder to get out .
hmm . we do not exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ?
she kept on bothering me .
is it the rush hour ?
it feels like ten degrees below zero at least . i do not mind the cold weather but i do hate it when it gets slippery .
did not you just eat ?
i want you to cut my hair shorter .
i do not want to go all the way home just to eat .
i am afraid i cannot agree with you there . your price is much higher than other companies .
i would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer .
stop , stop ... we are talking about our son is attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
i cannot let anything happen to that tripod . can you guarantee it will not be damaged if i check it in ?

please drive slowly , we have got lots of time . safety first .
i am sorry . i cannot quite follow you . would you mind speaking slowly ?
a little bird whispered to me . keep that to yourself .
do you really have all of these drugs ? where do you get them from ?
about 2 weeks .
i am sorry we will not . you can wait for two weeks . if you do not get a telephone call , it means that you were not successful .
no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i did not really need it .
we can buy a three-liter bottle . it works out cheaper per liter . we should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
is there anything else , sir ?
okay , here you are . she hands the completed form and the money to the clerk .
i am planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed .
would you like to have some more beer ?
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it is a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt they are really good !
ok . but can i trade my seat with you ? i prefer the one near the window . i am a terrible flyer . i always get airsick and can never relax until after i have landed .
it seems reasonable . by the way , i can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , cannot i ?
no . the only thing i have ever done behind your back is zipping you up .
if that is your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you do not have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
pity i have not . if i can afford it , i will certainly take a trip abroad .
i said by the middle of oct . this is the best we can promise .
are you serious ?
i hope you enjoyed your stay .
oh , that is funny !
i want to buy that candy .
why is that ?
no , thanks .

i notice there is a jam a few blocks away .
you are welcome . please press the button when you need any help .
ok . this machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change .
do you like it better here or at pcc ?
it does not matter . but i really have not gone for a picnic for a long time .
ok . you can keep it as long as you need .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it is not very large at all .
yeah . it will be a shoppers heaven . that is the use of net in e-commerce .
only one night .
i do feel like an outdoor exercise . after all , we have not had such a beautiful day for a long time .
unfortunately , it does not . however we can give you a 10 discount on the frame . we also offer a very good financing plan . there is no payment no interest until next june .
yes , that is right . we want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
alex , you do not know what to order . let is go to a chinese restaurant together next time .
i sure did .
it is out in the suburbs .
that fee should keep you from overdrafting .
that is too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
thank you very much for your kindness .
we will make it except a jam . you know it is rush hour .
that is good . i want to invite megan also . next time you see her , can you tell her for me .
it is extremely beautiful . this is the very thing i have been dreaming of . please put in a gift box for me .

as a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
what makes you think so ?
yes . she treated us all fairly . she do not have any teacher is pets .
but i am still traditional , so i felt weird when she paid for herself .
i see , mr . baker . how many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ?

let is see . gas , food , recreation , we will not spend much . come on . do not hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , have not we ?
yeah , it is gonna take you a while if you go by foot . i would say it is about a 30 - minute uphill walk . you have to be as strong as a lion to make it .
sorry to hear that , i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , i really enjoyed our last chat .
i studied at anshan university .
i think my husband has some .

finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain was not all that hard .
yeah . the final is next week . you have to watch it .
i do not see why not .
i am not sure . but if you are only going to stay a year , i do not think price club is good to join . they have great deals occasionally . they are very good for people who like to buy new things all
of course . i always keep what i catch .
so complicated ! ok , what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
why ? did you open an attachment ?
what services come with that ?
forget about the coke . let is drink some wine , shall we ?
now , tell me what you often eat .
that is fate .
sorry . i think that is the cheapest
it is at the back . i think you are near-sighted . you had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses .
you should go to the park more often since you do not go to the gym anymore !
he is quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . he gets different tie each day .
yes , i am afraid she gave you the wrong information .
definitely . there are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain .
just a couple things , here is a list .
let me see what is available .
we are gaining a day .
oh , it is rather too high . we have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price .
i am returning a cellphone .
it depends on the time of year . at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . we also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . we run a very tight operation !

that is really interesting . you have to play for me some time .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well , mr . brown . i am happy to say it is nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .
i am not exactly sure if it is your department , but i would like to ask some questions about qualifying for comprehensive credit granting .

yes , where do you want to go ?
hi , dr evans . thanks for seeing me on such short notice . when i woke up this morning i had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . i think i am coming down with the flu .
i know a lot of people would not agree with that .
hey , that is enough about my hair .
here i will take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
that is correct .
do you really ?
no , they did not . you could order it from the menu . i think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet .
that is nice , have you been to the movies lately ?
i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i cannot eat anything .
they are similar to an avocado . when the outside feels soft , they are ripe .
that sounds perfect . thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me mr . parsons .

in that case , i would suggest our own hotel restaurant . the chef , the food , and the service are outstanding .
i ran into the guardrail when i turned to the left .
it is about as complicated as chess . the basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .

ten and a half .

may i ask if there is anything wrong with it ?
your daughter . she sold it at the school auction .

please come in for a cup of coffee .
i have read your resume . i know you have worked for 3 years . why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ?

oh , i am so sorry . i thought you had one . here you are .
what about mr . white ?
i will share it with one of my friends . what is in a one-bedroom apartment ?
how could i help but follow it ? the fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! the exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we cannot do anything about it .
to some extent , i regard books as my good companion .
can you working under pressure ?
hey , andrew . how is everything with work ?
but this chance is really precious .
fine . you can either park in the student lot or on the street . do you know what a handicapped space is ?
since it is your first time to vienna , i think you should go to the concert .

i would like to use a computer .
but then you have to change the litter box .
how about giving them to that old man ?
ok , it will be a new experience for me .
it sounds so moving .
yes , it is not easy .
that is really great , jill . so , what do you do there exactly ?
yes , thank you .
this is rachel in human resources . i need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes .
all set . and we are having a red bean cake and dim sum for the taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted .
oh , no , never . what is the exact time you would like us to call you tomorrow morning ?
thank you very much , sir . i will put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you .
ok ! would you mind writing me a doctor is note for work , otherwise they may think i am faking it !
did they mutiny ?
do you always put a quality mark on each container ? for this shipment it is crucial to us that you do .
yes , she does . she works at home .
i got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes .
all right . just wait a minute , ok ?

since leaving school , i have attended typewriting and shorthand classes , and have now attained a speed of fifty and ninety works respectively .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i did not enjoy was the subway .
so remember to set your alarm clock .
great . where is it ?
what will you do this vacation ?
is that phoenix time ?
sure , i will go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
you mean that is my business .
elvis presley . do not you recognize his voice ?
arm ... just the usual , current deposit please .

there you go .
you are very welcome .
thank you , sir . i will tell him you called .
yes . if i do not make it to beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . how much does it cost ?
what is the specialty of the house ?
do you know this is a onaway street ?
as a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant l c . it takes longer , of course , for special orders . in no case would it take longer than six months .
sure , how much do you need ?
we could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . the prints might be put off to eight weeks .
i have both , but i usually use my car to get to school .
i guess so . but the music is too loud . i do not mind getting out and meeting people , but next time i will do it in a park .

merry christmas to you !
oh , is that right ?
what do i talk about ?
oh , goodness , please not again . that is what we did last week .
well , for city dwellers , the spring festival is a holiday of seven days . while in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .
bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... darling , it looks elegant on you ! it cannot be any cheap stuff . something around two hundred , i guess .
why do not we down to the pool ? it is not too far from here .

well , i certainly could not have done it without your help . you are the best tutor i have ever had .
well , we have a tradition in my family ...
sure . any specific reason i should know about in case people ask where you are .
they are not too familiar with doing business outside of japan . there are a lot of cultural differences to account for .
how many chapters does the book have ?
i know . do not remind me . i am starting a new diet the day after tomorrow .
she was great . in today is class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . she told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing .
i will let the bellboy know . do not worry , he is very strong .
you are very welcome .
you do not mind if i have one .
ask the worker who sells token to give you one . it is free of charge . actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations .
true . predictable weather would make life easier .
so , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you are in china ?
you are right . i am not going to play games during school anymore .

$ 3075 . our paychecks our $ 3300 , combined . that means we do not have any receipts for $ 225 .
i only had time to visit edinburgh .
how nice to see you again !
well . you are here .
i see , but games are played in different ways . i am wondering what type of games do you like to play ?
you collect them yourself ? i think that you are just doing the wholesale .
do you know what your credit score is ?
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
well , first let is consider your computer . here , for example , is a system i highly recommend--the power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
do not i have any rights ?
no i do not .
that is right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there is something important to do . the lunch break is flexible . you can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
an mp4 player ? why do not you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?
i will sing a chinese folk song love song of hanging , first in chinese then in english .
i will try to change one to a different day .
do not worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .
thank you very much .
what about your friend zoe
yes , that is true , but my wife found a new apartment on the internet the other day and she wants to move right away .
that is really unbearable .
yes , we have . what kind of room would you like ?
you mean the white building near the playground ?
ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... ray and i look forward to seeing you in june . write soon . with love , sue .
i see . i will have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . the burse will come in then to take your blood , we will run some tests , and then you can go home . you should hear from us
you should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him .
ok , i will get to work on it at once .
i am very sorry , sir . we accept only visa or mastercard .
yes , it is . thank you very much .
do not worry . i know about this .
sure , which one ? the red one or the blue one ?
you did a wonderful job .
the marriage only lasted about a year .
i have experience in computer operation , proficiency in microsoft windows , microsoft word and microsoft excel .
okay , here you go .
i would like to open a savings account . what is the interest rate now ?
will you have it later ?
it is a pleasure .
ok , tell me your friend is name .
sorry , turkey . i have already got dibs on the tv for tonight , remember ? and i am watching ' disco fever ' on channel 6 .
it is too high . i cannot reach it . could you help me ?
oh my god , that is great !
she had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . for example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined .
the compact ? why do you think that one is better than the others ?
sure . we have a good after-sale service . your satisfaction is guaranteed .
i am glad to hear that . congratulations !
i stopped counting at nine .
hi , i saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design .
there are not enough buses in this city , are there ?
i like it . it makes the city feel alive . i like all the different colors and i like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans .
of course , sir . did you have anything from the minibar ?
you should be . you worked really hard last night preparing for it .
if you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . the tuition fee will be financed by our company .
that is a little bit expensive .
i want to help with both .
i think tv is a great waste of time , so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
may i see your library card , please ?
and you are going to completely transform your eating habits , right ?
it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . keep surfing .
my diet consists mainly of fruits , veggies , and chicken .
birds of a feather flock together .
see you then .
yes , i found it again .
when i was your age , my parents did not have central heating like you do ! we had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . we used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! we never caught a cold . you should be grateful !
do you think that there is life on other planets ?
would you like fries with that ?
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
i see you have bought some coffee . would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?
my front window was broken .
really ? but it is my favorite .
i am glad to meet you , sue . please have a seat .
it is in front of you .
no , not really .
oh , thank you .
did you just arrive in this country ? you look a little nervous .
well , you are right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that is why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they cannot see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
coffee will be right with you .
yes , but i do not really use it often . have you ever used it ?
i am all set . thank you for the dinner , jack .
what is the new strike ?
do i have a choice ? uh . that is a no . what can i do ?
what do you drink ?
we have just 10 days for the vacation .
i will tell you ahead of time , that there is a lot to sign here , but i will help you every step of the way .
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they are priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .

well , hurry up and open the door please . i told you these things are heavy .
the one with a very big nose .
oh , that is convenient , but ... how much crime is there ?
oh , that suits you very well . besides it is believed in china that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
thank you , sir . hope to see you again soon .
sorry , we cannot come down any more .
i do not know where to go to find a nice bedroom set .
who is ms von ?
no , but she does wear contact lenses .
healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable .
what exactly did you do at that company ?
it is in aisle a .
they say my hair is too long , my room is too dirty and i am not good enough at school .
where are you coming from ?
what time would you like your table ?
vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month .
what an interesting family !
you are right about that .
does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ?
i would if i were you .
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
this is where we sing ? these booths are so comfortable i think could fall asleep !
but we saved your parents so much money ...
single or return ?
ok . how about some very cool sneakers for your children ? anyway , it will not cost you much . it is only around $ 59 . 95 for each pair . it might be cheaper than that in america .
how about you , daniel ?
where is gate 12 ?
no ! not at all . but i did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out .
yes , i am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam .
i also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game .
you know , sir , you do not have to use it . you can turn it on or off . if you do not want to use it , you just never turn it on .
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
all right . what do you want me to get ?
i like horror movies because i like to be scared .
i prefer the food at whole foods .
no . it is not . but sometimes it slows a lot in winter .
no , if you take some care when you use them .
which train do you like ?
see ? and i bet that is easy to do online . everybody is anonymous .
are apartments expensive in this city ?
you sound like the tv ! you are not going to tell me that aliens built the pyramids , are you ?
you got it ! just last night i made usd 150 !
it looks good to me . i would suggest that you put the client is logo and our logo on each page . the bosses seem to like that .
well , the starting salary for a clerk in our company is 2,500 yuan monthly and after three months he would get a raise if his work is satisfactory .
of course . here you are .
it is $ 180 .
me , too .
you are absolutely right .
thanks for the visit , betty .
you are welcome . bye !
twenty years ! that is a long time .
oh , i see .
for the bank manager ?
i am sorry to hear that .
i am thinking of dropping out .
oh , well . if i must , i must .
it must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds .
actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that is funny .
sorry . can you please help me up ! i have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on .
i think we will be better off if we are apart .
thanks for the invitation . i will !
yeah . i go shopping once a week
absolutely . thanks for coming rebecca . goodbye .
you should feel shameful for your behavior .
if you need baggage tags , they are found in the box on your right .
that is right .
oh , diane and i went for a drive in the country on saturday .
you are a real friend in need .
yeah , yeah , but today is lesson was all about the creation of the universe .
i got offered a new job !
come on , what have you got to lose ?
we are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a.m . next monday . do you have something to write that down on ?
but whether you like it or not , there is a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . and you need to accept this concept positively .
he wanted to live right on a bus line , but he does not . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1 4 mile to get to a bus stop .
well , she is not to blame . it is always difficult to choose between career and family .
that is right . i report to work at 5am everyday , and i only get 45 minutes for lunch .
sure . take as much as you want . they are free gifts from this shop .
i really hate this weather .
oh . that is very nice of him .
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
it does not matter , i can teach you .
do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?
yes , i did . but nobody has handed it in as yet .
you would better pay more attention to your health .
i am having a party saturday night at my house . if you have time , you should come .
that is good . will you tell me the details ?
well , i think you should come and have some fun . besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . you should at least try .
he is cute . what dose he do ?
another note ? but how ? i did not see anyone !
yes , i am a very good mother and successful career woman .
well , you look great ! how are you ?
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
no , but those guys like to hit on me .
well , i really like being with her .
you could not be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
i have heard that the ideal life school is famous . they offer many programs and there are many classes available . the charge is also fair .
i cannot come until next week .
how about your family ?
i drew a blank on the algebra test .
it is 3 nights a week , monday , tuesday and thursday .
do you know this song ?
that takes some time .
yeah . i should not stress about this anymore . it is not like i can do anything about it .
oh , yes , it does . look , here it says that the cd-rom is built-in !
that might be acceptable . i shall have to cable our beijing office to get their approval . you can definitely supply in the time you have given me , i suppose .
is there a problem ?
thank you for your payment .
does it taste good ?
i usually just drive .
but i think i can help to fix it .
yeah , i know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
hmm . this system seems to have everything i am looking for . it is a bit pricey , though . i will have to think about it . thanks for your help .
ok , i can do that .
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
i try to be sensible about it , but it is not very easy . sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .
to the traffic lights ?
look . it is begin .
thank you ... please sign on the line .
would you like to have a seat over there ? it will just be a minute . and can i have your name ?
well , how much are they ?
let me try . it has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... egypt ?
yes , i am parched .
is this your luggage ?
oh , so do i .
what kind of flowers do you want ?
then you have got to try it . let is go to the skating rink on thursday .
it is about six or seven miles . that is about the kilometers .
what did they say ?
they are . we definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved .
yes , sir , let me show you the table . this way please .
and the forks and spoons ?
here you are .
i am not 100 sure , around an hour ago i guess . i had it in the hotel lobby bar i used it to charge something to my room . i obviously did not pick it up again .
yes , it is . kelly ?
try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can .
ok . bingo ! we win . give me five , mom .
sure that is fine . here is the list of all the things you need to get . do not forget anything ! and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?
i know . and some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
his suggestion is that the work be started at once .
what is it ?
tomato , orange and apple juice , please .
news about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .
yeah , that is true . ok , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ?
you mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ?
that is great . we can go to the bank together .
can i send it in now ?
thanks you for the encouragement .
is everything ready now ?
actually , it is not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
okay , i see the problem . you forgot your code , did not you ?
you have got no guts !
somewhere new . it is a great place to pick up chicks .
you are a light weight .
she is got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
yes , i agree , but still a lot of people watch it .
if you want i will let him know if i run into him .
then you have got a lot of work to do . you need to get her to notice you first .
i do not know what to have . if you do not mind , i will just leave the choice to you .
see you , frank .
are you sure ? he does not look that old .
i think there is more you need to do .
that is great . can i book the room ?
what band did you pass in japanese language proficiency test ?
no , thanks .
so we are just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? i do not know how well that will go over .
you said it . good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here !
now the score is in our favor .
what are you talking about ? we had a great time . we laughed and talked all night last time .
well , i have been very busy recently and i am having trouble keeping up to date with everything , so i just wondered what exact service you offer .
well , i hope it is comfortable enough for you .
you will be covered by our medical plan while on duty . since you will be middle-anagement , you , re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours . any approved overtime that will be paid at time , which you can take as salary or time off .
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
yes , but there is a chance that might be suitable for you .
i think we might not see any .
it certainly is .
good , by the way , do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i have bought for you ?
sure . rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture .
well , it is not just the girl is fault . it is also society is fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , it is in to be thin . it is hard for them not to listen .
i would really rather not . i will be too tempted to buy something that i cannot afford !
i got sacked today .
can i give you a hand ?
i will have someone bring that up right away . how would like to pay for the dinner ?
they are reports of our company .
yeah . if we share the cab , it will be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
sure . brown and we have reserved a table next to the door .
my first name is j-u-d-y , and my last name is w-a-n-g .
what kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ?
how long would you like to stay with this company ?
do you know what you want to get ?
i do not know . if we cannot , we can buy from ticket scalpers .
yes , we do . what size do you want ?
i am going to the english class . it will start in five minutes , i have got to run .
you are something else you know that ?
yes . do you know its name .
that is true . but americans work hard for their money like we do . i do not know why our spending habits are so different .
oh , i see . by the way , what shall i do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ?
why is that ?
i would like that .
at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ' ve been married for a few years , she is starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother .
if you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside .
certainly , sir .
all right . but i am very poor at math . would you like to help me with my math ?
will the numbers mean anything to me ?
can we solve this later ? i am calling the insurance company .
oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? my car is still in the garage .
can you recommend one ?
hello , john .
it is almost exactly the same . i think it is a hilarious show .
what a terrible accident ! who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?
yes , he is . i have make an appointment for 10 of the clock , so i would better move along .
what was that ?
i attended school today . did you ?
of course , my grandpa is generous and kind . my grandma cooks the most delicious chinese dishes in the world .
yes , please . how much is it ?
how long is it ?
you can decide by yourself .
not too good , i am sorry .
we have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview .
are not there any trains before 10 thirty ?
this is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ...
my boyfriend says i work too much . that i spend more time with you than with him .
bill and betty have already grown up .
would you make gay marriage legal ?
would you like cheese on that ?
we have a two-for-one special on large pizzas . would you like a large pizza instead ?
yes , i hope we meet again .
it is us .
sure , let me take a look ... personal information , education , experience , training ... i think you should add another section for language . you speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
we all went swimming .
so , what is the status of our advertising campaign ?
ok . bye !
yes , it is .
would you wrap it for me ?
is that near here ?
you sure do .
it is already credited to your account .
i worked with him for two years . that was the worst time in my career .
oh , really . i like hot food . so what is your recommendation for me ?
so it is like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . i can do that , provided the company i am working for is not hurt .
thank you . nice to meet you too . i am john . is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane ?
i calmed up . and finally , i asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . i could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal .
thanks . will i be able to take a retest ?
ok , you are the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
how about some zongzi ?
his car was hit by an express train . it happened at the crossing just behind his house .
do they live with you and your parents ?
he is been on the gravy train these years , has not he ?
no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
i really cannot say how long she will be .
you know , i am a waitress at the student center . anyway now those final exams are almost over . i would love a night out .
this machine is out of order .
i thought i would have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there .
it is so nice of you .
no problem , that will be $ 5 . 48 .
let me have a try . the author takes the characters peculiar to the british people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . they are quiet , shy and reserved ...
what time would you like to leave ?
thank you , anne . you have done an excellent job . did they mention the date for the next meeting ?
thank you , but i prefer the fish
sounds not good . i will not take it .
yes . after trying a bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . have you got a larger pair . size 39 ?
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
that is easy . everyone knows that there are nine .
do you know how to set the timer ?
i did not know about it . what did you do ?
it is my pleasure , madam .
saint jude-he is the saint of lost causes . like my cousin , anna , who cannot stop getting pregnant . she is a lost cause .
actually , that is not true . acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places .
toys ? why do we need toys for a picnic ?
what a creep ! phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line .
it is $ 32 . 00 .
you have a point .
are bananas on sale today ?
i think i might like some chinese food .
oh no ! that is terrible !
did you vote for him ?
yes , i am looking for a job as a clerk typist in english .
they want to travel to europe next year , and will visit us at the same ae .
i think i will get my food from panda express , too .
i had a really busy day . i had to work a little overtime . in the morning an important client called to place a large order . i had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order .
yes , it is far quicker and less complicated .
ok . bottoms up .
let is have the salesmen for a demonstration .
two cars forward .
of course they do . you know , eliza , before i went over there i thought the same thing . i thought that maybe kids in taiwan study too much . but now that i have worked there , and taught them , i feel it is a good thing . their parents are very concerned about their education . more than american parents are . and that is good . american kids do not study enough .
do you want anything else ?
i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . we should be able to get plenty of customers .
what size prints would you like ?
it is all right ! i often fry sausages when my mom is not at home .
fine , we will do that .
yes , sir . how can i help you ?
i assure you that you are paying for quality .
actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . and is has heavy fog for most of the time .
what ? not my dad , i hope ! ?
i like both of the two hats . can you give me a discount if i buy both of them
you can buy some of these nice butterflies .
why ? i think the meeting went well .
we have spent $ 1,000 .
it was so fantastic i did not really want to come home .
marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . all together , there will be 15 events .
how can you tell the difference ? from what i see , they look almost the same .
i want to leave . we have already been here two hours .
of course . you can get it at the entrance .
yes , jane says they will go to china .
so how do you develop good relationships in the office ?
not really . i did some research about chinese table manners . the important rule is to remain silent while eating . of course , this refers to family meals only . not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . it is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . the table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . each dish should be placed in the correct position . when fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . if it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . the diners should sit close to the table so food will not drop on their cloths . no noise should be made when chewing . no one should move food back to the communal plate even if he does not like it . one should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . all these table manners are very similar to western habits .
no , firstly we sign the contract you pay 50 of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving .
great ! when i check with the others , i will send you an exact time . when you come , be prepared to do your presentation .
they should be there in the next hour .
i do not know . but they say that mrs . smith wears the pants in the house .
that is okay .
i am done now . do you like it ?
but we usually get a discount of 3 to 5 from our other suppliers . actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know .
okay , i will go take a look . thank you so much for your help .
how about the one next to the black gloves ? it is very similar to the one you like .
thanks , but actually i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
do you think they will get back together ?
they will just have to change their communication methods . i do not want any - one using instant messaging in this office . it wastes too much time ! now , please continue with the memo . where were we ?
that is fine . i appreciate your help .
it suits us fine . we will see you then .
that is good . thank you .
no , i do not think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
yes , it is . may i help you ?
what do you have in the bag , mr . lee ?
well , what can i say ? i did not know . oh , i meant to tell you earlier , your blouse does not really match your skirt . those colors do not really suit you either .
actually , i have to go to school right now .
i have enjoyed the conversation with you . we will call you within 5 working days .
all right , sir .
you need fruit and lilies . am i right ?
what ? do you mean that you are pregnant ? is it true ?
ok . i will be back soon .
take good care of yourself .
maybe not . dust is no longer a big problem in beijing .
a lot of things are not fair . that is life .
i twisted and turned all night , and could not sleep . i was worried about my mother is health .
i would get del if i were you .
alright . then maybe we can do the floor first . these wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . and me too i cannot wait to get all this old carpet out of here . but how can we get it out ? do we have to hire someone ?
oh , how annoying !
why ? are you kidding me ? a guy like that is hard to find . few boys are so caring , so patient , and did i mention he is hottie ?
i am afraid we will be late for the party .
they are fine , but i cannot watch a movie without popcorn .
well that is what being friends is about , is not it ?
thank you , mr . johnson . may i ask you one more question ? when will your property become available ?
i got robbed !
yes ! is not that exciting ?
it was the best game ever .
you came to the right place . any particular decade ?
i suppose so . i tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . certainly without my colleagues ' help , i could not do these things in such a short period .
i agree . and it is very convenient .
just a moment , please . let me check for you . a moment later thank you for waiting . i am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day . the next available flight leaves at 4: 00 pm on 20th . shall i reserve you a seat on it ?
that is such great news . i am really happy for you ! where is your office located ?
the cat has eaten my fish , i will kill it .
i have some problem with my work .
do not mention it . i am pleased to help you .
get out of it ! it was not as good as you think .

i do not know . it looks a little wrong down .
where do you live ?
let is go check out the kitchen . the printout says that it is quite large .

let is see , mr . horn ... the doctor is schedule is full today . would tomorrow be all right ?
i am sure you will pass it .

looks like the tv wins that argument .
yes , i have . i tried once when i visited your country last year . i think they were very tasty . can you cook them ?
i think you are right about that . i would need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .

i have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work . which would you prefer ?
that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday .
i enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes .
i am going to do some shopping .
i do not feel like going .

i want to work in the english department , as i am an english major .
what is wrong with it ? it is filthy !
there is nothing definite i think . i do not have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar helping me spot new friends .
in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .

yeah , maybe you are right . how about this outfit ?
oh , dear .

teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking .

ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ?
yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , do not you ?
i did not know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ?

yes . i thought it was excellent . did not you ?
i quit work whenever i get finished , usually about six of the clock .

i am embarrassed ! i forgot completely about them . i am terribly sorry .
yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
the neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs .

i need it sooner . let me have it in three days , okay ?
yes , i would better give her a call now .
do not forget the sun block lotion . you do not want a sunburn , do you ?
the color i use now is rose . how much does this rose foundation cost ? the 100ml bottle .
how can you be so sure ?
i see . well , it is nothing spectacular , but it is pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... o . k. , i think i will take it .
what ? then what did you do ?
i do not understand .
maybe you are right . but i am still worried .
traveling , swimming , going to the cinema . and you ?
would you come with me to look at apartments ?
it is almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach .
ah , it is clear enough to send .
yes , in most circumstances .
each night costs 320 rib , but for a four night stay , we can offer a discount of 15 .
sorry to say it , but neither of those . i am here to close our account with you . the market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it is just not sensible for us to stay .
certainly . i will be back right away .
you have all the fun , do not you ?
thank you for your consideration . we will inform you of our intention as soon as possible .
i am sorry to hear that . would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me what exactly happened there ?
i think so . but before i apply , could you tell me more about the work ?
sounds like you will be able to help me a lot .
my room is facing the swimming pool . it is noisy for me . i have a problem sleeping . and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator .
that is done . there is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account .
around 200 rib for a truck .
64 pounds , please .
i am afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation .
i have really bad poison oak and cannot stop itching .
a bunch of people went looting last night .

i used to be a better singer . i have not sung in the karaoke for a long time . it is your turn .

i am voting for the next president .

the fundraiser events went really well . we were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society . all of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
am i doing this the right way ?
you may put it that way if you like . do not worry . you will have no problem .
ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you will only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .
i have looked for , but i did not see any black ink .
maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people .
thank you , sir . i will leave them here . if there are no problems , i will mail them out this afternoon .
no , it is not here . damn it ! i am going to have to buy another ticket .

i am catching the 11: 00 train .

that is too high .
who knows ? you cannot judge a book by its cover .
ok , that is all of them . no more gifts . now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
you know , tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man .
is not there anything else available ?
that is funny , i did not know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .

green salad please .
actually i look at all of it and let is not forget class participation .
it is very simple . men shake hands , women and children do not .

for how much ?
would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ?
that is it . i decided to turn over a new leaf . i am going to exercise every single day .
the hours are from 9 am - 6
honey , i do not know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
that is my job ! is there anything else i can assist you with ?
let me check if we have any vacancies ... you are in luck . we have one single room available .
that is incredible . i cannot believe it .
geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling is not such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i did not become addicted or anything like that .
okay . what do you want to do ?
hello , mr . jones , its ...
i am not sure . but it will be at least ten yuan an hour .
it sure is . can i see your ticket ? ok , fine .

i am sorry you cannot borrow a jacket and a tie .
i think i can work well under pressure .
next week , so i thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible .

i am sorry . something is wrong with my taxi .
he must be very easy-going .
that is the best price we can offer .

do we also need to punch out after work ?
no problem , sir .
do not ' uh , dad ' me . sit down and have some lovely breakfast .
now i see what you read the book for . but it is fine . i will give you the lion is share .
i bet you will still buy it , though . you would not be able to live without your fashion magazine !
well , let me see . now it is 11: 00 sharp . it is a long way to go . if i take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam . if i take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you will have to pay more . which do you prefer ?
why do not you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
he said i should come by this morning . he did not give me a time . he said i could come any time before noon .
my teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . you ?
you should at least give me a call .
that is going to take a while to put together , paul .
look at the map . it has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects .
just having a chat .
we also have a cat and a dog .
well , let is try a size ten . he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on looks like a perfect fit .
have you checked the fuse box ?
do you know ' he ' is ms . rebecca !
ok , shall we go to pizza hut or pizza italia ?
i meant that they are very simple , easy to talk to .
i really like it here so far .
good morning , mrs smith .
yes , only one travel bag .
no , thanks . i am fine .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we have been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . cannot you give us d a or d p ?
what is it ? tell me ! will it work for lester , too ?
i will be glad if you would .
no . why ?
good . well , welcome aboard , ms , robbins .
not at all , but we do not have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
i think i might have bumped into her before .
i do not like them . i think they are too icky .
yes . what is this made of and how to wash it ?
that is a switch .
no , i am afraid we will have to cancel the order . i am not sure whether it agrees with me .
yeah . what a surprise !
here we are . you find us a table and i will get the drinks .
sure . thanks .
i am doing well , and you ?
i just felt that the paper could not offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
for 1,200 yuan to nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan .
is there anything interesting ?
yes , please bring us two steaks .
you are right . the air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green .
no , it is also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take .
same problem here . there is an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .
okay , i will see you at 6 of the clock . do you need any directions ?
nothing but the best , cinnamon toast .
mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester .
i am not being pessimistic . i am being realistic . my chemistry is so bad .
and your name and number ?
yeah , i do not mind it either . we will both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ?
no , it is just the two of us .
thank you . would you hang up and wait ?
thank you very much and anything else ?
that is no problem . is it cash ?
well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
have you switched on the radiator ?
they are right upstairs .
then i am afraid there is none in stock .
yes , he is very good .. is not he ? he told some funny stories too .
it says ' wet paint ! '
fine with me , but no more chafing dish .
oh , right , of course . here you go .
thanks a lot .
yes . here is a quarter . i flip it , you call it in the air .
i guess so .
any time after 6 of the clock is good for me . oh ! i am late ! i have a class .
of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me .
yes , now what do i do ?
i love sashimi . did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?
that is , your commission .
i am afraid we do not have any . if i were you , i would try one of the newspaper stands .
the ancient olympics originated in ancient greece .
never mind . it will be over in 10 minutes .
no , of course not . i have got a lot to learn yet . in the meantime , i just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone is toes .
you would better bring some medicine for airsickness .
yeah , it was nice to meet you . hope i run into you again sometime .
i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else is dime .
i am coming to inquire about the information of the company . when was this company established ?
how would you like it ?
yeah , i am going to be running the walker avenue branch .
good . i was thinking that i would like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
thank you so much .
so you just talk all the time ?
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
wow ! that is fast ! i do not think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
to tell you the truth , i do not like it . it is too noisy .
yes , please give him some water .
yes , ms . ross ? what do you need ?
i would like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister .
sorry . i am afraid we cannot . but you may order something else instead .
are you scared of anything ?
yes , i often feel like a million dollars after work , like i can take on anything .
great . but no talking , now . do not forget that you are on a ladder . take care !
i just do not know .
ok . when ?
that is true !
before the new year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . on the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' happy new year ' . it is also common for people to make a new year is resolution .
that is right . you should give it up , too . it is bad for your health .
what about soup ?
do not worry , madam . can you make a description of your baggage ?
does 6 thirty suit you ?
when we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in grangerfield .
it is my mother . she is sick and needs someone to take care of her . i am the only one who can do it .
i have heard about it while in china . it is called a yard sale . i did not have any idea of that until today when i came here to the big yard sale .
here is the check . i included a little extra for you .
let me see . that is no problem . i will see you then .
our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 commission .
are you serious this time ? that is wonderful news .
premium , pls . could you check my tyres , too ? i think they need air .
registration plus overnight ... err ... seven dollars in all .
oh , thank you . thank you very much .
good morning . i am looking for a new jacket .
if you like , i will take you to a new restaurant next time , i just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . it is such a great sichuan cuisine . would you like to try that ?
mr . mechanic , i would like a nice venezuelan blend this morning .
he is not answering . you would better check his pulse and breathing .
well , now you do not have to worry about that . this new place sounds really good .
yes , i have several copies , but they are all different versions ... the latest i have is version 12 , is that current ?
yes . in that case , you should connect the operator and he will connect you with the one you want .
over there are stacy and rebecca . we are all on the school is tennis team .
a hundred and eighty yuan for one way . we have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car .
yes , i have known of it .
yes . we are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad .
ok , i get it ! ! thank you for your very thorough analysis !
i thought it was great . did not you like the special effects rooms ?
i really like apples and grapes .
why do not we go down to the pool ? it is not too far from here .
oh , i do not know . it would take me a long time to go round the world .
our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by .
yes , he does . he of ten has had one to many . but i advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table .
sounds good . i do not want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
i can see it . the bus is stopping . i think we will be able to go inside .
what if i buy around ticket ? can you offer me some more ?
do you want to send it by air or by regular mail ?
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
we know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . however , our company has the regulation for the agency .
do not worry about it . it is on me .
that is okay . i can explain a little .
anything new at the office ?
i am already dialing , sir .
what do they look like ?
i honestly did not know .
yeah , you are right . i must stop complaining and stick to it every day .
oh . i see . i would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding .
i would like to return an item .
absolutely we need a house here . but what makes me upset is the prices in this city .
but it is unfair for jane .
i am sorry , sir . what seems to be the trouble ?
hi , i am liu ming . i am calling to tell you that i have got the job .
i can see the appointment that you had . what day do you need to change to ?
dear , let is drop the subject .
yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . however , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like .
your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things .
it is about 300 yuan .
that is a good idea .
you would think it would , but it most likely will not .
i think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage .
well , their inventors were not as clever as bill gates .
all the papers have been drawn up , but i will need to see your picture id so we can notarize these papers .
yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank .
hello . this is the operator . can i speak to mr . smith , please ?
does he have a moustache or a beard ?
i took something earlier .
i thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . what do you think about lavender ?
i think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator .
we have got four more games . i hope we can win all of them .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
no problem . i just got paid . it is my treat .
no problem . wish you a nice trip .
great ! i must warn you though , whatever happens , do not let me go on a drinking binge . trust me , it is not a pretty picture !
yes , sir , the specialty of our restaurant is the seafood .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
let is bygones be bygones , start saving right now .
well , i have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .
a post order for four hundred dollars .
well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday .
would you like to clear the table then ?
well , they are older , and they do not understand today is fashions . when they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . they do not like that style at all , and they do not like dealing with people who dress like that at work .
you should go to the dentist .
do you think there is anything we can do to reverse the damage that is been done already ?
wait a minute , please ... here is the cash .
thank you , sir . have a nice drive !
what do you mostly do during your workout ?
sure . let me ring this up for you at the register . if you would like , this can be gift-wrapped for free . just take it to the customer service department .
accountancy ? really ? she must be very good at figures .
that is the point . love among human beings is not limited by geography .
i am not sure , you know i am not familiar with the city , too .
it is a huge headache . i have no idea what i want to do .
yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters .
the cement arrived late but do not worry , i am confident we can still meet the deadline . the crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again .
so do i . the sun ... the sand ... the ocean !
i am leaving in two weeks .
what ? but it is my favorite piece of clothing .
what is your favorite color ?
it is once in blue moon .
i am here if you need any more help .
he won the first place !
do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ?
i am sorry , but i think i ordered waffles .
yesterday i met mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary .
do not mention it . i think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .
there is nothing i can think of .
if you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . you cannot have it both ways , of course .
how terrible ! this is quite unexpected !
is there a charge for that . i know other stores have a restocking fee .
are you enjoying married life ?
i did not like her butting in where i did not want her . she is a chatter box .
i would not call myself introverted . sometimes i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times i like sharing activities with others too .
you will find that out on your court date .
a little bit , but i know that the elevator is not enclosed . at least i would not be smothered there .
oh , of course . how silly of me to forget .
they ' ve just renovated the place . you may be surprised .
i wanted to go to malibu beach .
why not ? when i go shoe shopping , i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
i want to see a dentist .
no , i could not make it .
what the hell are you doing now ?
i want to know what it says .
that would be great . thanks !
sure . i just need to do one other job first . how about if i come up around 11: 30 ?
but we could not help it .
what is wrong with it ?
have you heard about our special promotion this month ? if you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow .
sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all i do just for our family .
so , what damage does ozone do to the environment ?
great . see you then .
oh , my dear lady . take it easy . you should forgive a green hand like him .
that is great .
that is right . we will finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project , but it is not due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done .
then one to new york at 10 thirty .
closed ? are you kidding ? what is it , some kind of holiday today ?
you are welcome , diane . i hope you can visit us again soon .
yes , surely .
we are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied .
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
now , many people think that women is liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . what is your opinion ?
what do you mean ?
i used to be like that . but i go skiing so often that i do not get excited anymore .
it is a pleasure to assist you . please tell me when you will be needing the room , sir .
do you know where the local office for this area is ?
oh , and it is out of paper . do you have any more ?
come here , please .
oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . we call her lulu .
say if the engineering department wants to hire a person , they will request hr to find candidates .
yeah . it is so nice of you to comfort me .
no . i do not . i suggest you look in the phone book .
you are so thoughtful .
i have heard . she looks quite depressed .
thanks a billion .
that is all ?
this pair is rolex , right ?
would you like to come and have dinner with us on friday ?
i want to find a new bedroom set .
it does not sound like an english word .
oh , never mind . i am just going to do the laundry today .
i am afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further .
it only takes a few minutes . some people like their meat well done . others like it rare . the great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .
i would love to have a home with a view .
is there a union ?
it does not matter . follow me , please . what do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
well , no . i thought i ve finish in five minutes . and i did not want to be difficult about just few minutes , if i had not been missing the bus and in the traffic i would not have been so late . i am sorry .
i will . thanks a lot .
jenny is getting married .
that is outrageous ! i just do not understand why they are not on top of this .
yeah , it is 30 percent off the regular price .
now , if you will just sign here , the mac is all yours .
oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . that is where many of them learned to play the flute .
you can ask the guests for help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .

it is my new radio earphone .

do you still want the car , sir ?
you are questioning my ability ? i tell ya , i can make it ! i will talk to your boss .
oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock-out . she devotes much of her time to her career .
no . you see , i went back to school to get my master is degree when i was in my thirties . you will not be older than that .
you are witty .
no , he cleaned it last time . it is your turn .
yes , you are right . i think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss .
what is the building to the south of the library ?
you have gone through all your money so quickly ? i thought you were well-off .
because i needed the money . and because i was good at it . look ! what do you think ?
about nine thirty in the morning .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the excellent teaching award the past two years in succession .
yes , speaking . how can i help you ?

good morning , vera , nice to meet you .

no strawberries . we will charge your amenities account , if that is okay .
yes . how long would you like us to keep it ?
i am sorry but it is for the best .
yes , but you have to calculate a little . you paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times . so you only spent one dollar per fall . that is cheap .
i am sorry , sir . it is our policy .
there is an ethernet cable in your room . just plug it into the back of your laptop .
oh , certainly . i am linda , the manager . i can help you with that . how many will there be in your party ?

about a 100 and i have had them declared .
he says kick mommy , beat mommy , do not want mommy , very quickly if i do something that he does not like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
what a pity ! i missed it again .
ok . can you give me a fragile label ?
well , i will just buy the shirt .
listen to the sound of nature ! it is like music .
what are you getting donations for ?
i do not know what to do about it .
believe i will . look for me near the lake .
no , i am still full from dinner .
oh yes , this is penny is pet boutique . please remind him that his appointment for his dog is shampoo and cut is on saturday morning at 11 am .

i think i will . it is difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
what is that building opposite us ?
ok . we will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . have a good day !
how long can i keep the books ?
okay , come right this way .
oh yes , he is . when he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father is shoes , but he is okay now .
is it a photograph or a document ?
i had a headache this morning . i did not pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i did not sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
let is see . have you been to a jazz club yet ?
hmm . do women usually work after they get married ?
you cannot be serious .
why ? do not you feel well ?
great , is our room ready yet ?
it is very quiet and peaceful . this is what i want .

i was born in beijing in 1965 .
she is indeed well . but she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet .

i am with you on that . check out that one over there . i think i am in love !
could you quote the price of cif hamburg ?
your company is products are mostly marketed in canada and the united states , but particularly have sold very well here in china . so i think in the future you will find china to be a profitable market as well .
are you telling me you are not going to meet with me ?
i understand . our offer remains open for 4 days .
do you think that is a good spot ?
it could . modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . they just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !
i doubt that .
one bedroom will be okay .
i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .
yeah , about 5 minutes ago .
you know , that is going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
maybe you have food poisoning .
i do not know him .
the only thing i really do not like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that is the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
ok , sir . please call me when you are ready .
the bus is turning right to buckingham gate . and now we are joining victoria street .
how long does the tour last ?
thanks for your belief .
do you have your library card ?
yes , of course . and i am amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers .
i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist .
where are you from , sam ?
this really is not the place for you .
but do not you think it is a little too cold ?
it is ok . i will call her back latter . thank you .
my advantage is that i have strong sense of responsibility . but i lack patience .
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
i will take it too .
yes i am . you can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , i can point you towards the right direction .
how about we go and get something to drink ?
all right , i will try my best . if there are not any holdups , i think we can get there in time .
will this be cash or charge ?
there is one class on tuesday and thursday from 2 to 4 .
is it formal or informal ?
i quarreled with my roommate last night . he is really stubborn .
turn right at the second traffic light and you will see it on your left .
only once or twice at the most .
that is right . he ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
i am quite sure . i have always loved working with children .
yes , i know . and next time i must make good preparations .
i like beer , it is just that i get a headache when i drink more than 3 .
you did give me a surprise . how have you been ?
no , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone is going to have a seat , do you have any ?
what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ?
as it is confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it should not take too long . there is , of course a service fee of 300 rib to be paid .
well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
i tend to only eat grapes and apples .
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
huh ? you are breaking our rule already ! and we did not even start to play yet !
nobody told me .
nah , i would not worry about that . but i do not want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
how come i never knew that ? do they have a new baker or something ?
what time exactly ?
yes . in fact if you look at my resume , you can see that i was a manager before i started this job .
slacker and those who violate working principles .
i prefer a package tour , and we do not have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things .
are you depositing cash or a check ?
all the parts work .
would you like another beer ?
it is true . everyone kept looking at him . it was so embarrassing as i was sitting right next to him .
so you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
he joked later that i was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant .
well , can you help me look for it ? that is my first time here .
good morning . i would like to book a room for friday night and saturday night .
what do your parents think of your dating a boy ?
i think it is just a matter of getting used to it .
here you are , miao ping . do not laugh at the horrible photo today , ok ?

yes , that is a video camera .
all right . i hope we will be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
certainly . how much rent did you want to pay ?
no , not usually . most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church .
oh , you read ? very good . then , i think we should do something different today . i will give you some privilege .
well , probably . probably you will have to wait in line if you do not have tickets .
well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
mangoes . what are they ?
i ... i failed to pass the examination . how i wish i had studied hard .
if you make an appointment with a job counselor , they can also provide you with a lot of information . do you want to see a counselor ?

yes , i am positive .
i am afraid not , unless you want a night flight .

well , tom . it is good to meet you . i have to go now . i am teaching a class this evening , and i need to get to the college .
no , i have not , but i have seen several interesting advertisements in the paper .
why not ? let is draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first .
how were your scores in university ?
keep in touch then , ok ?
what is your problem in working ?
mr . smith , please .
i agree she had the right to say something , but i feel she should have done it privately .
but i want to watch tv now .
the letter reads , please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . i do not see anything else in the envelope ...
eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
lulu . lulu . say hello . hello . oh , she is so smart . good bird .
i think you are absolutely right . actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
not that long ago ! i am not more than twenty-nine myself .
one dollar . drop it in the box . move to the rear of the bus . there are plenty of seats in the rear .
tracing back , yoga has a very long history . it was originated before india had approved yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . in other words , yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled .
have you booked the hotel for the reception ?
single or return ?
that is the charge for insurance i see on my pay slip each month , right ?
not very well . i have not found anything within my price range yet .
quite a lot . i need one pound of potatoes , three pints of milk , a dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes .
right ! anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .
how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
absolutely . that is because both of us have distinctive cultural features .
what about that one ?
after the tour i will have a rest . and then go to find a new job .
yes , that is funny . i thought you liked it .
yes , i think i can in ordinary circumstances .
would you please let the next applicant come in on your way out ?
sure . darn condoms are not registered in our system .
i am running a high fever and feeling terribly bad .
i would like to go to the railway station please .
nice meeting you , kevin . i hope to see you again .
in spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum
well , how long is it from here to the train station ?
there were charges on my debit card that i never made .
just cats , but i do not think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
indeed , i agree that is not a good start . how about the meeting ? you missed anything important ?
where are the keys ?
you mean we cannot stay in this hotel tonight ?
of course not .
let is go check it out again !
no , i am used to having tea first .
be relaxed . she is familiar with the area .
did you buy new cupboards too ?
did not you sleep well last night ?
what would you like for your main course ?
what ideas do you have if we employ you ?
yes , this coming saturday .
i do not think so . let is walk by the stream . i am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .
i did not think there would be a problem .
maybe we should turn on the news in case it is supposed to get worse .
i have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . but i still have not got it . i am so hungry now .
yeah , but so what ! i am proud to live in the world is most exciting city . and , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
that is good , thank you .
surely , of course . what kind of currency have you got ?
yes , it is , but you will have to discuss the details with your manager .
that is a good idea .
do they know what the robber looks like ?
is it possible to change to another room ?
too bad . i hate transferring during a flight . it is too complex .
it is on at 8 pm at the phoenix theatres . i have a membership there , so i can book the tickets ahead of time .
fine , five more minutes .
do not worry . it is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . just to finish it is considered a victory for most .
you want to throw me out over this ?
certainly . it is quite simple really . do you hold a resident is permit ?
ok ! then what can i do after i finish it ?
elvin does not want any programming help . he wants all the glory for himself .
the two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .
i am sorry . sir , i will check for you . what is your room number ?
you would better remember your promise .
well , you cannot give her granny panties . have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? we have got these lovely , silky nighties . or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . look , here is a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it .
that is a good idea . which one do you recommend ? the pairszone ?
what kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
that is incredible . i can not believe it .
how much do you think we should leave for a tip ?
i do not understand .
sure . what is it , yvonne ?
yes , i am here for an interview as requested .
he meant it in a good way . you added a little spice to the performance .
yes , because of fewer people .
haha , i am afraid it is simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
that is so simple . i will come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . thank you very much , tina .
that will work out fine . to make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network cannot cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and i will not miss any call .
what qualifications have you got ?
have you heard about our special promotion this month ? if you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any elizabeth arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow .
then the shipping documents have to be attached . that way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms .
me too . i like the festival best of all .
i do not entirely agree with you .
i have had it on and off for the past three years . it is just gotten much worse these past two weeks .
sure you can when would you like to come in ?
i have got a run . can you tell me where is the restroom ?
what is your passport no . ?
cannot elvin handle it ?
ok ! how about scrabble ?
yeah , i think so .
who taught you to put on make-up ?
oh , how adorable ! she is got your eyes .
did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
yes , how long will you intend to stay ?
it is raining . that means you need not water the garden .
sure , where is your office ?
what is your favorite dish or dishes ?
sounds good . i will take paper-cut .
why do not you find someone who is in the know .
ok , tell me .
a friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . he was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .
let me see . laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... oh , that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
hey let is go out tomorrow night . the ram bar and grill is having a special on pitchers .
ok , dear . we will be late .
what ? what is wrong ?
well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
where do we get off the bus ?
how many rooms would it have ?
is there a package with basic and movie channels ?
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
do i need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
ok , i will find the time to relax soon .
you are right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just does not seem very interested in our friendship anymore .
you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
i wonder why tv programs often show much violence .
it seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten .
are you still working ?
considering that it is over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird .
yes . the limit is four per family .
the tie is necessary for man . it makes you look so attractive in a super tie .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i am glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up camp . here , mary , help me lay down these beach towels .
oh you are exaggerating . i am never really good at making hairdo .
i found them at jc pennies .
hello ? yes , someone has passed out at dongle ave . and 2nd street . he is not breathing and does not have a pulse . yes , my friend is performing cpr . ok , thank you . they are sending an ambulance . here , let me help .
i am fine , mom . remember holly ? this is her roommate , yi-jun ..
sure , since i came back from the us , i have been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like .
coffee , please .
right over there .
if we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
that is not like you to generalize .
can i help you ?
do you have any other questions ?
yeah ! he is very good at showing off his knowledge .
are not the trousers a little too long ?
it depends . if it has something special or useful , i suggest you send it out .
i prefer to learn english . in my opinion , english is easier than chinese .
but yesterday you said you would rent it .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
is there a waterfall ?
breakfast is brain food . maybe that is why your grades are suffering .
i am pretty good , you ?
you have nothing to worry about .
it is pretty violent , but since it is just robots fighting one another , it is not very bloody and so it will not gross you out .
i said that you are supposed to have an interview .
who is winning ?
my grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold .
i thought it was pretty good .
yeah , it seems like we do not talk the same language as far as movies are concerned .
from august fifth to eighth . just a moment . yes , we have a vacancy for that period . what is your name , please ?
since the may holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here is the phone number .

oh , yes . that would be better .
good idea , let is shop to we drop !

the bus i took .
that was not very wise , sir .
so sorry to hear that . what is wrong with you ?
well , we will supply you with an apartment of a bedroom and a living room .
that is all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we will be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! till next time !
yes , of course . do you like a jade necklace ?
what did you say to him ?
probably two days . my wife will join me tomorrow . then we will decide when to leave for seattle .
every two weeks you will receive a continued claim form that you must turn in .
i see . does he live by himself ?
i do not think they are right . i have tried my best and that is enough . it is unfair that they are always saying these thing . sometimes i even feel deeply hurt .
it looks fine . is this an inclusive tour ?
actually , we have a few to choose from . they are over here .
that is great ! how much is it ?
i have an appointment at one fifteen .
yes , it is very close . the subway station is next to the hotel . you can walk there .
there is nothing that can be done . everything is gone . i wish i could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . we will just have to figure out a way to move on .
oh ! good evening . i am sorry , but she is not in . she is gone out to the theatre
they walk over to the apartment . as you can see , it is large and completely furnished .
no , and let me tell you why ... if i make my guys stay over to check the inventory , i will have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . i estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 ... if you need the numbers that urgently , i can have them do it . otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and i will call you with the numbers after they are done . it is your call ...
thank you very much . see you then .

oh , sorry . there is a pencil behind the cup .
watch your language or you will be spending the weekend in your room .
the franchised store is on the second floor .
meat , i think .
yes . what can i do for you ?
of course ! let me take it out of my wallet .
i must have slept right through it .
i still think nobody plays for nothing .
sounds like an italian name with an i at the end .
i do not feel so good . i am feeling sick to my stomach .
do not worry about it ! just come at five .
sure thing , follow me . this here is the .
ok . i have got a list of place that fit your requirements . let is just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it is on a noisy street and it is a little far from t
there are not so many people like you .
i am an engineer at ibm .
sounds good . when and where shall we meet ?
sorry , the connection is terrible . i will call you back because i cannot hear anything .
yes , it is .
no , i do not think she is that strong-minded .
i have to admit it is easier said than done .
no , i do not think i have . but i would like to hear the full details , if you think it will be beneficial to me .
yes . we will also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun .
tell me what the problem is .
thirty percent discount , ok ? that is the lowest price .
poor ben , your wife is too mean to you . she gives you so little money every time when you are out .
yes , i have my ticket with me .
ok , no problem . have you found the blank ones ?
yeah . i was so happy , because my favorite singer , ricky martin won ' best latin pop performance ' .
not if you are good at net-working . do you like to meet new people ?
if you need anything else , please feel free to ask me
what do they need all that money for ?
i am so sorry to hear that sir , let me check and see what is available , what room are you in now ?
then you have heard from vital ?
i think that it is around 600 .
i know , but there was nobody else .
do you accept checks ?
most of it is . you should sign up .
what should i do with my legs then ?
sorry , there is no flight available on july 21st .
did you have anything to declare ?
i am sorry , madam , there is a limit to the speed .
i do not think the exam will be very hard .
at least she did not suffer .
not so well . i have come down with the flu .
i wish i could , but i have got to go now . i have an appointment in 20 minutes .
no , thanks . that will be it .
what courses have you completed at college ?
wait a minute , i will bring you some juice .
here is your boarding pass . have a nice flight .
did he crash ?
i want to check these three pieces and i will carry this overnight bag by myself .
ok , i will search it for you . a moment , please .
i really like those . how much did they cost ?
no , thank you . i had too much to drink yesterday evening . i had a bad hangover this morning . my head felt terrible .
here is some sugar .
i think you are looking at the wrong line . the rapid drop in sales was not our hair products . you are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . the one that did not do so hot this month was the cleaning products . i think there was a problem in the marketing plan . some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales .
maybe all of us are the same .
i really could not understand him .
does the tour have a chinese-speaking guide ?
sorry , not tonight !
ok . maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
well , there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
look , i need another drink . do you want one ?
i would like to send this parcel , please .
it is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . what do you think ? do you want to quit your job ?
but if you were me ?
it works better than any medicine , lily . i will make you a glass right now , and you will finish it !
you can easily download it from their website .
i am going to need to see your id and $ 27 for your permit .
maybe some other time .
the air-conditioning is already off , madam .
i know ! it is gonna be great . but what kind of music do you think we should play ?
for each month you would have to pay $ 1050 .
i know . but i promise i will not be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard .
the lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . however , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . this will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues .
yes , sir . and there is also a party going on each saturday night in the bar till next morning .
i know , mom .
i do not like them . i used to take them when i had to work overtime , you know .
what are your salary expectations ?
send me up three bottles each of perrier and jim beam .
i do not know , sir . but it will not change much .
yes , but the results are not so satisfying .
yes . the drinks are very good ! i am paul , by the way .
yeah , what is up with that ?
i do not think i have ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . he does not seem to like anything . which kinds of paintings do you prefer ?
so you are leaving this evening , we will keep your bags until 6pm , here is you tag .
when did you come back ? did you have a good time ?
that bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
not at all . welcome again .
i do not know .
you ? wow . and why do not you ever dress like that at work ?
usually people leave 15 , but this was exceptional service . i am thinking that maybe 20 would be appropriate .
how long will you be staying at hotel in china ?
probably not . after all he is our teacher . we should try to find something nice to say . if you cannot say something nice you should not say anything at all .
then i guess you are healthy enough to clean your room before school .
the hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . what does that mean ?
that is just wrong ! why do not you just quit ?
you would have to use the computer lab . i am sorry for the inconvenience .
not yet . oh , madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . will you take them ?
well , i enjoy the popcorn and being with you . you are more important than the movie .
it is hard to say . but i do love waltz very much .
i like macs . how much for a mac ?
you did not pass the test .
sure . it is seven eighty-nine .
no , there is plenty of gas . i filled it up yesterday .
right . later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . when he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous .
well , that is also very efficient , right ?
the company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . company policy is not negotiable .
visual c , c and delphi .

bring me one and besides , i would like to have a chicken cream soup .

well , i know how to turn it off !
what is on these days ?
she is the mature , stable , feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her .

i still have 5 days to practise . it is in the bag !
paper or plastic ?
it seems quite normal to me . it is pretty much what i want to do .

well , it would be foolish to call the police . he probably just went away overnight .
let is look at that another way . the major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger .

they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
let is order something to eat . what are you in the mood for ?
well , i am really passionate about consumer behavior , so i pursued a master is in that area . i also strive to keep my professional skills current , so i continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service .

really ? oh ! i am glad you let me know .
this guy just robbed me right on the street .
it is in the south of china .
what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by lao she , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . it is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people is spending power either . teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal just like a coffee bar .
and the other half come in later to pick up the second wave .
am i in the twilight zone ? you are charging me for a movie i never saw ?
i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along .

now this is our office block . we have all the administrative departments sales , accounting , personnel , market research and so on .
you can get the same product at a much lower price .
that would be fine . we could accept a lower rebate .
how about the mongolian hot pot ?
maybe . i do not know .
fine with me . i know the laws of the road . i am not worried .
yes . how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
what is your reservation number ?
did you ever win any competitions ?
that is perfect . i will let him know tomorrow . thanks !
i am not familiar with that part . let me call someone in charge .
what a miser ! he cycles to school every day .
well , please look at the employment contract . i would like to go over the main details again before signing . first , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved .
could you please look at the five men in this line-up ?

i do not mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good .
yes , i have got it .

we receive credit card as well .
well . i have done a lot of business for my company . and now i feel like going into business for myself .
that is right . mom did not know where to buy chopsticks for you .
can i take the subway to get there ?
you need to fill out an application form .
are you sure ?
that is impressive . how would you make that pay ?
that is true . but i just love it . come here !
even if an item is on sale ?
yes , i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years . i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there is something urgent .
what kind of style are you getting done ? can we match ?
yes , we met last year at a conference .
i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets .
if you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . but cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking .
is there anything else ? maybe i can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot .
i apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . i hope you have a nice trip home .
i have got to think it over some more .
how about playing tennis with me ?
it is facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! it is magical .

you smashed my bumper in with your car .
sure . but it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . have you been hiking before ?
oh , my god ! he is so perfect .
that is alright . i just cannot bear losing track of all the latest information . it almost drives me crazy .
you must have been speeding .
let me see . it is 800 per set cif london .
i know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and i just cannot do nothing .
shall i give you a ride home ?
of course . i fed them today .
i put all of that information in the packet . i will give you another copy if you need one . see you on monday !
the cranberries . i love their music . how about you ? do you like them ?
yes , we have . we have had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .
i think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems .
go alone if you want . i will wait at that cafe and have a soda .
i will go .
you mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !
can i get the ticket here ?
he is really great . he has sold millions of records worldwide . he is especially known for his rocking performance at the football world cup song-the cup of world .

working under pressure is exciting and challenging . i do not mind working under pressure . i work well under that circumstance . people can , i can .
she probed my teeth and checked my gums . well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . make an appointment for next week and i will take care of them .
come on . put the gun down .
that is right .
it is not that hot . it is cooler than yesterday . let is go swimming !
any terrible fines ?
but you have to pay the fee for refund .
that was a cake walk . it is nothing to speak of .
let is do that then .
yes , i do . i think we can compete . i think we can make a name for ourselves . it will be hard at first . but if we develop a good advertising campaign , i think we can break into the market .
much better than mine .
certainly , ma ' am . just take these stairs down to the first floor and turn left . you cannot miss it .
yes , i would like to place an order for toner cartridges . we have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time .
just a moment and i will check . we are expecting a delivery on friday . we have only got ten in stock at the moment . i can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . there will be an extra charge for special delivery . i will have to send them by courier .
that should work out great . you are miracle worker ! you have got me awake and motivated .
great ! when do you take over ?
are there many accidents in the city every day ?
that will be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , do not you think ?

but i cannot miss the flight . it is an important meeting and it is waiting for me .
you will have a definite answer from us within a week . goodbye .
well , i suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person is life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things .
i am off today .
will you be getting another copy ?
make good use of that day off you will only have one this semester !
oh ok , i will try that tomorrow . it will probably be better than fighting with the traffic ! go on , why do not you come along ?
that depends a bit on the problem at hand . there are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail
i would like to report a break-in .
before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
i am worried that what i say will not make sense .
oh , yes ! i did not think about that . thank you for reminding me . how many days should we spend on a vacation ?
us dollars , please .
you know students use tested message service . and they provide favorable service for that .
and i represent ?
i did . why ?
ok , thanks .
maybe your boss is not so horrible after all !
i am open to relocating .

well , there are actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that is half the collections of antique objects in china . there is one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections .
i suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips .
i guess so .
i will fix these problems when i get around to it .
to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .
i hope so too .
oh , wow ! it is really him ! who is that woman he is with ?
we can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan .
we do not think so . casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
it must be strange for you to live in taiwan .
i could , but all they ever talk about is work , so i always end up feeling left out .
i love it . it is so festive ! and where did you get that cup ? it is got the same logo as the car .
seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem .
i totally agree . i really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and i do not want to argue about cleaning the apartment . my last roommate was a drama queen . every time i forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it .
sure , in order not to leave a bad impression on the interviewer .
yes . but if i have any more soup , i think i will die .
ok . how about this card then ?
it was seven feet tall .
i need to get a letter of credit . is this the right window ?
prepare the list , mother . i can go shopping . i can go to the small stores . everyone knows me there .
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
i have got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache .
do you have your negatives ?
i will pick you up here tomorrow .
ok , but do not tell anyone what i said .
it is a very important experience for me . first , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike .
i would forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . he forgot to mention that she happened to be in new york at the time 3000 miles away .
yes . we had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf .
it is deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in japan .
that is great for me . look , children is clothes ! i would like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter .
i will be leaving the city soon so i have no need for this account .
interesting . what do you think about families with only one child ?
may i see your ticket , please ?
hi tom ! i am fine , and you ?
you have formed a sound habit .
what about a factory tour ?
thank you . i am sure i will have a wonderful time here .
what is the reason that people prefer to read this one ?
well , i was discussing the contract with bill and he said that they met the head of lawsons last week .
it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language .
tuesday night is when we need the reservation for .
then why could not i get strike on the first ball ?
i am sorry , but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
i am not going in the wrong direction , am i ?
you did not ?
that is good . we always need team players here .
i heard about that . it was successful .
you need all your receipts for reimbursement .
you ? play badminton ? that is unbelievable ! you are shorter than a racket .
oh , here . i am afraid it will be difficult to repair .
i would like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday .
no , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . they are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training .
not bad . but i have made too many flights these days . i could hardly remember how many take-offs and landings i have been through these three days . i think we all feel a bit tired .
the phone bill is in my name .
fine , thanks . i will go to mainland china for a business trip tomorrow , and i want to change some hong kong dollars into renminbi .
show me the fastest way to get there .
yeah , i am with you on that .
why do you say that ?
when will the lecture begin ?
ok , i guess it is worthy of two yuan .
no , they are filed according to dates .
tom got along well with classmates . he is really a good boy .
no . have you ?
sure it is . i am up to my ears as time expressed .
i have been a salesman .
sure . what time do you want to go ?
it is 3 . 2 . you may earn a little interest on money .
i am still suffering from a little jetlag .
i see . is it your first interview ?
yes . as a matter of fact , you cannot board the plane without boarding pass .
try the lipstick as well . see , how fresh and charming you look .
what else would you like ?
if i had chance again , i would major in english . you are good at language .
yes , that is in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help .
and bugs . they can catch anything .
thank you for hiring me . see you then . bye .
well , i think you are pretty lucky actually . you will have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
what is up ?
i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
good . one more thing , we would like you to quote us on cif basis .
my present pay is rib 3 , 000 yuan each month .
well , their team work is well worth learning .
i see . come here . the high heels here look really attractive . but i wonder whether it is comfortable to wear any of them ?
that will be a big help . well , here is a list of some of the food you could buy .
you should just get the basics .
what are those ?
when you move out , your father and i are not paying your rent , young man . get a job .
yes , i would like them sent to this address .
i was thinking that i would like to see the secret life of bees .
good idea . we can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning .
a soda sounds good .
i cannot bear being near cats . they do not seem to like me either .
yes , what style do you prefer ?
but you will miss out on the football game .
what is the cause ?
great . please fill them out on this deposit slip .
oh , what is it ?
anything wrong with it ?
i am sorry , sir . you bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . let is meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed .
i think it is fairly useful , but there are two big problems . first , a lot of the information you find online is false . second , when you buy something online , you do not see it until you actually get it .
i understand . that is why christopher and i want to find a place in a small town , far from the city .
he brings with him some talented people from his former city .
that is good for me , but do you think you will be back by then ? i would really like to see you .
do you think you are the right candidate for this position ?
that is incredible !
how long can i keep the books ?
yes . i received my bachelor degree in business administration .
yes , i think so too .
sure . let me look over them and i will bring them back this afternoon .
ok , we will come at half past eleven tomorrow .
well , first of all , you need to make sure that you eat the right foods .
good gracious ! what is that ?
are you nuts ! i am not going to run a red light !
then do i have the chance to get this job ?
that is a bad habit .
hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then .

you are kidding . what am i going to do ?
i am in pretty bad shape , dr . ford .
i have got a sore throat , a runny nose , and a headache .
i did not know that bus went to the gold line station .
that is right . the company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating .
i came to see my aunt .
beef , please .
hey , that is not fair . i did as much work as you .
i hate balloons .
let me help you .
yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ?
that is right . but do not worry it is a very simple procedure .
i think i am getting a heart stroke .
i am not a very good sailor , either . my mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . in fact , she never takes a voyage unless she has to . i am better than that , and even on the pacific . after ten days of it , i can still find my sea legs . well , happily we shall have a smooth passage today .
take care and give my best to your parents .
no , it is easy . we will just take the shirt back to the men is department and show them the sales slip . they will exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .
hmm , that is a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i am really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
i know . our train system is lousy . and besides , americans love their cars too much .
thank you . you save me .

yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal .

just two months ago . there were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . i took part in the great parade myself .

you can have a try . maybe you will like it .
you have no choice , so you would better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time .
what do you mean ?

we have half-hour and one-hour treatments .
yes , mr . michael ?
i am calling about the apartment for rent on main street .
i am allergic to these things , you know .
he made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . do you know what i mean ?
ok , how about 1: 30 pm ?
that depends on the day . we sell from here and on the internet . i would say about twenty to thirty per week .

and the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live .
i hope so . thanks .
wow , good for you .
thank you ! your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! are you shy ?
i want to pick up my parcels .
how long is the holiday ?
i see . is this yours ?
do we have the same classes today ?
just now we both thought it would be fine .
ok . 72 yuan .
there are not a lot of clothes , do you have a lot to wash ?
how do we get to the library from here ?
no . i think i have known enough . thank you .
okay , it sounds good .
what can you expect ? not that good .
ok . there are five people in my family , father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and i .
i cannot wait to go there myself .
i know . but why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ?
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just do not know what to do first .
i would like to , but i have got to write a term paper . it will be due by this thursday .
i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , do not you ?
i can help you figure it out .

yes . that is from 6: 30 to 9: 00 in the dinning room .
well . as you understand , the irrevocable l c gives the exports additional protection of the banker is guarantee . we always ask for l c for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by l c for our imports . we only accept l c for regular orders .
then what else should i put into my resume ?
what kind of things did you learn ?
you would better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . that will put you in a insurmountable place .
ok , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ?
it is in the dx community , room 306 , no . 2 building . it is very easy to find . just ask the guard at the entrance .
would an order of only 100 units , it will be difficult to work within that kind of budget . maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out .
sounds like it was ment to be .
can i pay by a credit card ?
but when and why did you leave the company ?
we charge $ 5 for a barrel .
i know it does . i catch this bus a lot .
mom ! i was just picking my nose , and now it is bleeding .
i do not have to pay any fees ?
i am just looking at this map of the world . i am preparing for a geography class .
hello , have a seat . i am bill gotcha . i am assuming you found your way here with no trouble ?
yeah right ! i am serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it is really not healthy !

that is easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me .

sorry , but i am not really interested in those things .
yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . i love traveling places .
when did it become cabs ?
if i were a manager , i would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . it is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction .
well , if you think you are ready , i will let you enroll .
you will never guess what happened today ! i went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ...
so this is a real thing ?

i greatly appreciate your help .
there are three people in my family .
no , they are from other factories .

there are not many places that sell used things in taiwan , besides auction websites .
what did you think of it ?
but you should make up your mind first .
what number is the suspect ?
that is exactly what i want . how long does it take ?
yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like .
of course . mary is our most experienced member .
you have no idea ! there is a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it !
you are right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . but i think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now .
just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . make sure you will not lose your temper !
queen , nonsmoking . okay , sir , your room is reserved . now if you will just give me your phone number .

yes . i hope so .
oh , for pete is sake . this is cosmetic . my brows are falling out . i did this for convenience .

i get it . and ... ?
joanna , give me a break .
may i see the room ? i will take this room . is the rate for a room only ?
that is good answer . i appreciate your being frank .

i think you are making a mountain out of a molehill . it is only a superstition . it really does not mean anything .
yes , i am my liu . thanks .
i did not see it .
i hope you will try to convince them to step up production .
let me run and check .
you have been very helpful .
that sounds kind of fun , maybe i can get tighter with my friends that night .
two , a boy and a girl . they are already grown now .
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
that is correct . with del you can do both .
well , you can just comfort yourself like that .
yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .

they are glad that i finally got a boyfriend .
and what is more , in traditional chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
how long will i take it to get there ?

i have thought about it for a long time . i think it is time to move on for both of us .
ok . so i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
i want a dog . my friend mindy is dog just had puppies and she said i can have one .
you are right . if she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , would not it ?
do you need anything ?
and i have got to drive . you know i am not fond of that . i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
thank you . you are very kind .
maybe it can take effect .
ok . i see . thank you .
i just cannot wait to see them . which one do you choose today ?
yes , is not it .
where is yours at ?
that is a little complicated . you will get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people is life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
and if people drop them , they will not break . we will need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .

i have a menu from your restaurant . i will order using the number of each meal from your menu .
no . i have not , but i will take only a few minutes of his time .
washing clothes at a laundromat costs a lot less money .
so i take it you are not interested .
what is the reason for that ?
you are right . let is ask her to give us one more week .
thank you , and i am sorry for the change of plans .
you seem excited about it .
what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
that is a good idea .
really ? me , too . what is your favorite flavor ?
i called in sick .
yes , i once booked there . they give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . you can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . they also provide e-tickets , meaning you do not need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . you go to the airport directly and check in with your id card .
may i have your ticket and passport please ?
no . it is on me this time .
let me put it this way . i have never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because i could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down .
sure . what do you want to know ?
come on ! you can just walk up to a girl and say if you were a booger i would pick you first .
maybe you are right . well , you can talk with them .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
we will send a squad car shortly .
you are so lucky ! do you have to do many things before you leave ?
no , what ?
i think so . would you mind telling me the postage now ?
no , but i think it would be really great for people like you who are always on the go .
i also realized this issue . and office automation is essential .

yes . how much do you want ?
i have got my money and my keys , so i am ready .
i had some good financial news yesterday too .
but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake !
well , let is move , i can see a rest area ahead . we can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ...
she is quite young and her hair is blond .
all of the produce is in aisle a .
i am really enjoying it here so far .
actually , i want to buy some traveler is checks .
yeah , we probably should . how much is normal ?
hello , could i speak to the export manager , please ?
oh , yes . i like to exercise . but i do not watch sports or buy sports magazines . i do not have much time to do those things .
here is my ticket right here .
what do you use to check for high blood pressure ?
well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it .
my warmest congratulations on your entering the oxford university .
that is wonderful . thank you .
i think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . all you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ...
certainly . this is an international company , and ther are good chances for you to work overseas .
yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?
well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total .
right . let is help each other .
yes , it definitely bothers me more when i do that .
wow ! i am very excited about your ceremony .
we use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find .
getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . using my speciality in marketing and management . and getting advancement in salary and position . show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing .
let is go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
quite a lot . the celebration of the new year has just started . the first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the north have jiaozi . afterward , we will make new year calls on family relatives , husband is side on the first day and wife is side on the second .
would you please help me send these clothes to the laundry ?
that is a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
it is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview .
oh , yes mr . chou . we have been looking forward to this .
he seems sincere , and trustworthy .
it is easier doing this kind hard work when i know that i trust the man behind the posters .
yes , i would like to check out .
not always . but they like good meal .
just three . i will be back at 3: 00 p.m .

thanks , dear . i feel so tired after a whole day is work .
i do not know how to use it .
sure thing . might there by anything else ?
how exactly do you figure out the car fare ?
but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway , i am not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
no problem . do you need another film ?
i am absolutely sure i am right .
oh dear ! that is terrible ! what was in your wallet ?
we have not decided yet . could you give us a little longer ?
how long will the tour take ?
we all know about that , but we have no choice . the chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management .
of course . the fitting room is right over there .
it is amazing that these things still work as well as they do .
i did not know that .
but sir , i did not drink at all .

i believe it . hoo , this car corners like it is on rails .
he put it out and flew back to the airport . then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was .
yes , why ?
yes , the fuse had blown and i have changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out .
be patient , miss . it will just be a second .
honey , listen to me . first , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out .
here . do you have a registration card ?
how long did it take ?
i inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through .
what happened yesterday ? you forgot our date , did not you ?
alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ?

wait a moment , please .
but how ? so you knew all along i was with webtracker ? how did you know ?
yes , on the cancer ward . and taylor was there . he walked right by me and did not even see me .
you must be lonely . i will share my friends with you .
i like to do just about anything outdoors . do you enjoy camping ?
i am ! i have made lots of friends and i really enjoy my courses .
er ... what else can i tell you ? er ... she is got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth .
when you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be . do not you think ?
then say it .
we have over sixty employees . we have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . we started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot .
if only he knew it .
by the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ?
well , i can help you pack . we should start looking for a new place for you asap .
that is terrific . thank you .
what a waste . it is good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols .
yes , but i did not really like the third one at all .
my pleasure . how do you want me to do it ?
why , she is only $ 29 . 95 .
sure , i have . will you join ?
when can i see it ?
it sounds wonderful . did you take lunch with you ?
do not worry . i will help you with it later .
a brand new taxi is pulling up now .
left at the lights ?
well i wish you luck .
no , but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt did not attend .

that is the least amount you can have .
you too . thanks for dropping in .

i can deal with that , sir . are you interested in our personal or corporate card ?
hi . this is amy yang . i am calling for a home phone cancellation . i am moving out next month .
that may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge .
great . we have a very pleasant working condition and i think we have a fine staff to work with .
i am lucky i was not killed . i must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out .
that is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . may i have some idea of your suggestion ?
it is interesting , is not it ?
maybe now i will get that promotion i was hoping for .
yes , mr . forester .
well , it is different in different countries . but it is because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .
well , you know that this job center is here for your use , so help yourself . good luck !
usually it is two dollars off the cover price .
oh , come on . jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime .
ok . thank you for your help . that is very nice of you .

i can just take it from your account , you do not need to give me cash .
no problem . that can be done . i understand you will ship the goods before the end of may ?
ok , next ?
are the rooms nice and bright ?
you have got a point . once i dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . then when the relationship went bad , he fired me .
that black sheep . it serves him right .

thank you . the same to you .
focus on being relaxed and open , do not forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . i am sure you will do well .
i think it was about 45 minutes long .

there are several tiny countries in the world too . countries like monaco are smaller than many cities .

how about mah-jong ?
that is good .
i do not have it .
i went bankrupt and i am flat broke now .
i have tried diets before but they have never worked .
i am completely serious .
for sure ! i mean we have learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply cpr !
certainly . as you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
yeah , is that all ?
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did not treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ?
yeah , this dress is really nice ! how much is it ?
they are not evenly matched .
here is 20 .
it is worth a shot . maybe we will get some luck in thinking up something for this case .

myrdal , purse do not just disappear . think carefully . when did you have it last ?
mainly plastics . plastics are not bio degradable - they do not break down easily in the environment - so they should not be thrown away .

have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ?
you know i did .
in a way that is right . but the vikings travelled there long beforecolumbus . and what about the red indians ?
oh , it is jack . excuse me .
great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
it is the same as usual . the only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment .
from what i hear , they are very reasonable . a lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives .
why not ? i have got the rings ready .
you can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter .
winning is a piece of cake to me .
where did he go ?
ok , could i take a look at some id please , like a passport ?
fine . how are your term papers ?
he said that he would probably invest most of it . he is got a well-paid job , so he does not need the money to cover day-to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires .
okay , now if you could please verify the room rate here , initial next to the x , and sign right here . how many keys will you need ?
but you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year .
$ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you are going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who ...
sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , do not you think ?
just a second . i will go get some .
that is a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free !
25 cents a day ?
oh , come on ! a tour of australia would be relaxing because you would be doing something different and not working .
i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they are so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings .
thanks a lot .
hey , that sounds a good idea .
you would better not . informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
okay , i will pick you up at eight of the clock .
woo , i cannot help being there .

no , i do not often dance . is not this a wonderful party ?
well , i approach things very enthusiastically , i think , and i do not like to leave something half-done . it makes me nervous . i cannot concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished .
you mean your friends . i think it is cruel .
that is true . but it is a little strange because the media often reports on political events . you can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv .
if i go there , will i be able to collect money right away ?
let me see . it is 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
oh , you are such a good child today . come here . sit next to me .
that is wonderful . i will see the old faithful for myself .

sound nice , i will try it .
you are welcome . good luck .

well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . this irritates real hackers to no end .

sounds ok to me . i like movies . hey , joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . and the club jackets - they are really hot ! i think we made the right choice !
yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other .
good idea ! i think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .
my friends and i just got back from bali .
is it easy to learn ?
but how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ?
oh , no ! not again .
i guess so . i live next door but one , and hope you will drop in now and then .

there is no need to apologize . forget about it .
yes , there is a department store in wang fu jing .

how long has it been on for ?
i am sorry to hear about that .
ok , where and when should i meet you ?
do you know what to get ?
how do i use it ?
do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that is impossible .
what is your favorite dance ?
that will be six dollars . out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . thank you .
i am afraid not .
what is the fee ?
so , will i be able to find this book ?
vanilla with toppings is my favorite .
then you can take route no . 5 . next i would suggest the international dragon boat race where you can watch lion dance , dragon boat racing , and many other water shows .
do you put your feet on your own table ?
i see . this is my advantage .
did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ?
no , thank you . i want to have a look at that scarf .
what is that ?
yes , of course .
no , ice will spoil the taste .
you are right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
that is why he is very popular among girls .
yes and no . i cannot wait to go to europe , but at the same time i am terrified .
it does seem like the perfect day ! i am glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca
yes , do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
i went to salt lake city on business . what is up ?
that is good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .
is it good ?
then , why did not you do that ?
oh , look , what is happened to jack ? he sat down .
the only problem is the price . it is not possible for us to make any sales at this price .
no , you do not understand , i need this tomorrow morning ! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife is dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! she is gonna kill me !

ok . i will keep my promise .
if you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ?
cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... i cannot keep them all straight !
the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
yes , it is definitely a growing business .
then may i suggest a family suite ? we have just had a cancellation .
your name , please .
here is $ 15 . keep the change .
oh . it is a nice day indeed
let is see . that would be 160 a day a mile .
i will . will you be voting ?
sure , no problem . as i said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . you do not have to worry about it .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .

i am fine too , thank you .
i did not get any of them . i was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and i never got your message .

yes , i also need all the letters we received from them .

will you take long ?
then what is the problem , sir ?
definitely beer . two bottles .
ok . shall we say next week , on tuesday at 2: 30 ?
me too . i need something to read on the flight to new york . i can never sleep on planes . sarah wants to pick up some children is books for her daughter .

oh , he is fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
we should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job .

that happens to be my favorite . waiter , i think we are ready to order .
you cannot be serious .

just two people .
i am sure you have the wrong number . this one has been my number for more than 20 years .

yes , i would like to keep both classes .
it quit working last week and i have not had a chance to buy a new one yet .
what especially about the night life are you going to miss ?
but i would still like ...
because i admire your company . yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city .
me , too . what would you like to do ?
i kind of do not want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received .

i am sure it is wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
of course . i have arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning .
no , not at all . his examples are really interesting .
would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on tv .
david took me to it last week . i thought it was a little sick .
oh , it is a disco . let is dance .
here you are .
you would just let sleeping dogs lie .
no , sir , you have to deal with your own meal since we charge you only $ 80 for the trip .
it is very confusing to know what to eat .
you refused the gift ? that is terrible .
i like no . 4 .
this one , of course . your company is my first choice . i want to work for you .
the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .

the first step is to fill in the account opening application and the accompanying seal card , stamped with your company is seal . i mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . we also need your business licence and the enterprise standard code certificate . then we can go on to the next step .

ahahah , and i thought you were tired .

i do , that is why you should appreciate this gift !
what day will you need it for ?
is there some reason why you cannot get enough sleep ?
it would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want .
i am afraid not .
so how come it is still playing ?
that sounds good . do i need to bring anything ?
but they are not very fashionable . what about these ?
i have no reason to distrust him . he is never caused any harm .
yes , i do . it saves me a lot of time . i also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines .

it is not too salty .
even if it does not work , it is a beautiful collectible .
well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ?
i did not realize it was a romance novel . what is the main storyline ?
maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at hamburg or london . if the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . this would make the blouses spotted or ruined .
how have you been treating it ?
by the way , what should i do with the key when i go out ?
that is a deal .

is there anything i can do to help ? just remember that i am there for you if you want to talk about it .
he is out of his office .

well , little girls seem to love barbie dolls .
what is the matter ? it does not taste good ?
ok , i will try . as for stamp , do not you think it is an expensive hobby ?
brown , please .

that is a matter of opinion .
you are right . thank you for the advice .

that is why i promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week .
what are you going to cook ?
it is supposed to rain .
how about a china vase ?
ok , see you then .
pretty well . i think the boss liked my ideas .
that is ok . thanks for your help .
but it will not be on my birthday .
how much longer is it going to be ?
i can recommend the spare ribs . they are very tasty here .

it is . get in . please . you are holding everyone up . you cannot miss washington square park .

well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company is dress code .

have you heard of hot fuzz ?
of course not , i appreciate that .

the mini bar door was open when i checked in . i did not use it . could you send someone to check it out ?
i do not mind helping .
what are you talking about ? my alarm even has not gone off yet .
well , i have got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . it may give you a feeling to reduce it .
how did you know that ?
i am looking for an mp - 3 player . which brand is of the highest quality ?
i will go to the yellow stone park , and great canyon .
fine . how is jim ?
well , i sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , i do not think there is any thing anyone can do for you . you were trapped in the system . if you want , you can talk to the director . she will help you if she can .
i have , actually . how about the movie , million dollar baby with clint eastwood ?

i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents .
yes , you came here on the right day . they are on sale today .

i agree . as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects . that is frightening .
they let you go , did not they ?
it is quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
normally , i would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight .
perhaps . i just have not had time to find them yet .
oh . what about saturday ? are you free then ?
that would be fine .
dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike del .
bundle up . it is wet and rainy out there . here is some soup .
why ? what had you expected ?
i divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . it can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students .
when i need to make a quick breakfast , i just make some oatmeal , toast , and oj .
that is because you do not exercise . if you were more active , you would not have a dieting problem .
you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .

i hope i can stay here longer .
these are chucks .
i did not just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good .
my fault . i did not realize what time it was .
it might be the english teacher . what about you ?
that maybe true , and i for one do not want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these ces ask for a bailout when they are making millions of dollars ? and then , they have the nerve to fly to washington in private jets ! this costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! and they are asking for money ! that is just not right !
absolutely . now i understand why he responded that way .
but the traffic is pretty bad .
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i do not think he won anything .

how could the news get any worse ?
yes . when the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . the bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . the one who does will be the next one married .
come with me , please .

i only started looking for a job a few days ago .
i will send someone out to take a look at the problem . will you be home this afternoon ?
good , about the essential living conditions ?
in all honesty , it is also a great deal for our company . the exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . we accomplished as much as last year is advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .

get a transfer from the bus driver .
you know only one aspect of him . do you know what he would do in the kitchen ?

it is at the corner of that street .
then my son drove into a tree .

well , it is a really high target .

do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer .
all new members are likely to ask the same questions . haha . i can understand that . every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . after you have been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . the leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
that is the spirit . i will see you tomorrow after class .
that is fine too .
it ended in a tie .
that is true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . he must rely on his eq to deal with them .
after i have 3-4 years of work experience .

monica , wait a moment . i think we would better call the repair man to do it .
how many vegetables do you steal today ?
sure ! it is not a real figure , of course . it is just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence .
the national anthem of canada is ' o canada ' .
do you have the package with you ? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . would you please keep my reservation ?

i see . what else ?
really . for me too .
the color and style are consistent with the sample . great !
the same to you .
yes , of course . i will take it .
do you take credit cards ?
i really appreciate that i would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
oh , no . we have bought your return ticket for you . i think you will find it comfortable .
to which direction did he run ?

it is comfortable , but now i am a little tired .
thank you very much .
do you mean that a native does not make any mistakes in grammar ?
have you been working hard recently ?
absolutely . to be frank , i learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . i am thinking of my kids there one of these days .
you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her .
no , of course not . i already bought them a present .
cheer up ! do not let me down . we all make mistakes , and that is life .
it is good . it is a nice room .
that sounds ideal .
thank you very much .
they said that they did . i have been so busy ...
that would not seem right .
yes . when can i get the decision ? i hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . if i would turned down , i ll have to secure a position elsewhere .
i knew this would happen some day ...
yes , pretty well . i have started learning english since primary school .
that is a secret . i could not tell you .
easy . i could do that with my eyes closed . after a while done .
is not this the car store ?
well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . i thought i would try it once , and if i did not like it i would stop .
fine , i would like two enlargements from this negative .
that is exactly why my business is doing so well !

sure . but my beard is rough .
if that is the case , i will have to go somewhere else to meet my needs .
here is my friend bob .
good morning ! i would like to buy twelve tickets to beijing for october 14th .
i am going to clean it .
show me your torgue . what did you eat yesterday ?
then what about tea ? we need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the chinese people .
my roommate invited both of us to dinner .
i feel the same way .
who is looking after him ?
i prefer it to working independently . i think most people do .
well , dhl is famous for its speed and reliability . it is the fastest international postal service available . the document will arrive in two or three days .
yeah , i would like to go . do you think we should have dinner first ?
oh , i do not know . it depends .
well , these are for internal use . you take a packet each time . four times a day .
is it a long ride to beijing library ?
i had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost .

my first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . i do not have more chances to enrich my experience . then i got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . i have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job i am doing now , but i think i have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where i could make solid contribution .

yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . you will see the post office on your left .
i know sir ! we did not expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . on the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . we could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box .
for now , i would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned .

yes , i am sure i have been here before .
there may also be a strong wind coming in .
where do you want to go ?
then 100 us dollars covers everything , does not it ?
what is strange about that ! as a person born under the sign of cancer , i am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . but according to astrology , sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking . they seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .

i prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it .
sorry . no . you need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle .
well , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions .
i want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future .

is something wrong with me ?
many thanks for your advice .
what about a two-bedroom house ?
i know what you mean there . in many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse is sake . and that is what we do when drinking at a banquet . even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like matai and showing yellow rice wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . we just be its dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship .

i am going to need someone to come and fix it for me .
well , i guess i exercise about two hours a day . i do aerobics three times a week , and the other days i play badminton with my husband . i always feel good afterward .
